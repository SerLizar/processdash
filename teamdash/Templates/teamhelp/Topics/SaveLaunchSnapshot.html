<h1>Save Backup of Project Data</h1>

<p>At the conclusion of your team project launch, you should save a
data backup of the team dashboard. From the main dashboard window,
choose C&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Tools&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Save Data
Backup. This will save a ZIP file with a snapshot of the data for your
team project. You can use the Process Dashboard Quick Launcher to open
this backup at any time in the future, and view all reports exactly as
they appeared when the backup was made.</p>

<p>It is also a good idea to save a data backup each week during your
project. This provides a useful history of your project's
progress.</p>

<p>At times, you may need to share a copy of your plan with a manager
or other stakeholder who does not have the Dashboard Quick Launcher
installed. For this purpose, a second export mechanism is provided
that saves a non-interactive copy of the team project plan summary
form. To accomplish this, open the team dashboard, navigate to the
team project, and select Save Snapshot of Project Plan from the script
menu. You can choose to save the file in various formats, which can be
viewed later in programs such as Internet Explorer.</p>
