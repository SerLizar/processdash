PROBE Methods A, B, and C all draw a line describing some trend in
your historical data.  The following parameters describe that line:</p>

<p><span>Beta0</span>: describes how far away from zero the line is when
it crosses the vertical axis.</p>

<p><span>Beta1</span>: describes the slope, or steepness, of the line.</p>

<p><span>r<sup>2</sup></span>: describes how well your historical data
points fall along the line.  When r<sup>2</sup> is 0.9 or greater, the
line describes your data points very well.  When r<sup>2</sup> is less
than 0.5, your data points are too scattered for the line to be
meaningful.</p>

<p><span>p</span>: Sometimes data points fall along a line by
accident.  The number p gives the probability that this has
occurred. So if p were 60%, it would mean that there was a 60% chance
that your data points just fell along the given line randomly, and
only a 40% chance that the line describes some real relationship in
your data.</p>
