<h1>Cumulative Direct Time</h1>

<p>This chart shows whether you have been able to devote as much time to
your work as you originally expected.</p>

<p>The horizontal axis depicts the passage of time.  The lines on the chart
convey various measures of direct time:</p>

<ul>

<li>As you log time against the tasks in this task list, the dashboard will
calculate a running total of the number of hours you have spent, and will
display that running total as the blue <b>"Actual"</b> line on this
chart.</li>

<li>The red <b>"Plan"</b> line will display a running total of the number
of hours you planned to spend.  (This information comes from the schedule
table, which appears on the lower half of the Task and Schedule
window.)</li>

<li>After you collect time and mark at least one task complete, the
dashboard may be able to calculate an adjusted estimate of the number of
hours that the work will actually require.  This projected cost will be
displayed on the chart as a green <b>"Forecast"</b> line.  If the dashboard
is able to compute a 70% prediction interval for that forecast, the
interval will be displayed on the chart as a green cone around the forecast
line.</li>

</ul>

<h2 NO_NUMBER="t">Interpretation</h2>

<p>You can compare the Plan and Actual lines to determine whether you are
devoting as much time to the work as you originally expected.  If the
Actual line is below the Plan line, you are not getting in enough hours;
this could potentially cause you to fall behind schedule.  If the Actual
line is above the Plan line, you are getting in more hours than you
planned.</p>

<p>Remember that this chart only displays the time that you have logged to
the tasks in <u>this</u> task list.  It does not display all of the time
you spend in the office.  Accordingly, if your actual time is too low, you
may be able to remedy the problem by eliminating workplace distractions and
finding ways to devote more of your time to these tasks.</p>
