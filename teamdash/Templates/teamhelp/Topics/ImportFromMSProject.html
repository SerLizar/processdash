<h1>Importing Tasks from Microsoft Project</h1>

<p>If a team has performed some preplanning using Microsoft Project,
limited portions of that data can be imported into the WBS
Editor. Specifically, the following data can be imported:</p>

<ul>

<li>The names of tasks, and their hierarchical structure</li>

<li>The existence of task predecessors</li>

<li>Cost estimates for tasks</li>

<li>Resource assignments, if resource initials match exactly between
the MS Project and the WBS Editor's Team Member List.</li>

</ul>


<p>However, this data import has significant limitations and caveats;
please read the section below very carefully.</p>

<p>To use this feature, take the following steps:</p>

<ol>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>Open your MS Project file. Double-check
that the resource initials for each team member match the initials
you've used in the WBS Editor's Team Member List.</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>Choose &quot;File&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Save
As&quot;.&nbsp; In the &quot;Save as type:&quot; field, choose either
CSV or Text format.&nbsp; Click the &quot;Save&quot; button, and MS
Project will display the &quot;Export Wizard.&quot;</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>On the second page of the Export Wizard,
it will ask whether you want to create a new map or use an existing
one. For simplicity, you can choose to use an existing map, and on the
next screen, choose &quot;Task 'Export Table' map.&quot;</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>Click forward through the screens of the
Export Wizard until you reach the page listing the data fields that
will be exported. If you wish to export resource assignments, add the
&quot;Resource Initials&quot; field to this list.</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>Finish the Export Wizard. MS Project
data will be saved to the file you selected.</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>In the Work Breakdown Structure Editor,
open the Team Member List. Double-check values in the &quot;Est
Hours/Week&quot; column, as they will be used to convert MS Project
cost estimates (which are typically measured in days) into WBS cost
estimates (which are measured in hours). Save changes if necessary and
close the Team Member List.</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>On the WBS Editor window, choose
&quot;File&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Import from MS Project CSV file&quot;.
The WBS Editor will prompt for the file to open; browse to and select
the file you just exported from MS Project. The new tasks will be
added to the bottom of your WBS under a node called &quot;Imported
Items.&quot;</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>If your project is a member of a master
project, you will need to copy and paste imported items to arrange
them underneath the appropriate core work items from the master
project.</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>MS Project unfortunately has no idea
about the process phases in a high-maturity project. As such, you will
need to manually configure the type of each imported item by clicking
the icon on each imported row.</li>

</ol>

<p><b>Important:</b> Although this data import feature can be helpful
for some teams, its functionality is very limited. Its
<b><u>only</u></b> purpose is to reduce typing for teams that have an
existing MS Project plan.</p>

<p>Teams should <b>not</b> expect a robust transfer of data, as most
of the fields in MS Project will not be imported. In addition, this
import feature is unrelated to the dashboard's ability to export the
GANTT chart for an earned value schedule to MS Project.
Round-tripping is wholly out of the question.</p>

<p>In addition, the EV scheduling techniques used by PSP/TSP are
completely different from the critical path scheduling techniques used
by MS Project. Task predecessors imported from MS Project will
<b><u>not</u></b> be used by the dashboard to perform critical path
analysis. As a result, all of the chronology information in the MS
Project plan (e.g. start date and end date) will be lost during this
import.  Individuals will still need to use the &quot;Flat View&quot;
to specify the order in which they will perform tasks, and the
dashboard will calculate task start dates and end dates based on that
information alone - not based on any information found in the MS
Project plan.</p>

<p>Within the TSP community, some teams <b><u>do</u></b> successfully
use MS Project alongside TSP earned value analysis, but no automated
support is currently provided for any ongoing, two-way communication
between the dashboard and MS Project. Also, reconciling critical-path
scheduling techniques with direct-time-driven earned value planning is
beyond the scope of this document.</p>

<p>To reiterate: The only purpose of this feature is to reduce typing
for teams that need to import data from an existing MS Project
plan. Any other expectation from this functionality is
unwarranted.</p>
