The word <span>outlier</span> is a statistical term for an unusual
data point.  When you have a collection of historic data points and
one of those data points is <b>very</b> different from the rest, it
may be an outlier.

<p>Identifying outliers is not a simple task.  You can't just look at
the data points and throw out the ones that don't fall along the
best-fit line.  You can generally only decide that a point is an
outlier if you are familiar with the project in question, and you know
that something unusual happened on that project to skew the data
point. 

<p>For example, if your computer were to crash halfway through a
project, and you were forced to start over, that project would likely
end up taking much longer than expected. The resulting data point
could fairly be considered to be an outlier.  On the other hand,
making a bad estimate is <b>not</b> an unusual occurrence, so you
can't throw out data points simply because your estimate was bad.

<p>If you recall that unusual circumstances affected a particular
project, you can choose to discard that data point, to prevent it from
skewing PROBE analyses. In general, however, it is best not to overuse
this privilege. For more information, see page 507 of the book,
<i>A Discipline for Software Engineering</i>.
