Errors.Version_Incompatibility.Title=Data Version Incompatibility
Errors.Version_Incompatibility.Header=\
    This Process Dashboard dataset makes use of functionality\n\
    that was introduced in:
Errors.Version_Incompatibility.Item_FMT={0} version {1}
Errors.Version_Incompatibility.Upgrade_Message=\
    Unfortunately, you are running an older version of the\n\
    software.  You must upgrade before you can open this\n\
    dataset.
Errors.Version_Incompatibility.Missing_Message=\
    Unfortunately, you have not installed these package(s). You\n\
    must install them before you can open this dataset.


Errors.Corrupt_Statefile_Title=Cannot read hierarchy file
Errors.Corrupt_Statefile_Warning_FMT=\
    The dashboard was unable to open and read the file that\n\
    contains your hierarchy.  This problem could be caused by\n\
    insufficient file permissions, or by corrupt data in the\n\
    file itself.  This is a very serious problem; the dashboard\n\
    will not continue until the problem is corrected.  Please\n\
    examine the file:\n        \
        {1}\n\
    and correct the following error{2,choice,0#|1# on line {2}}:\n        \
        {0}\n\
    If you cannot correct this error, the only other course of\n\
    action is to rename or delete the file.  This effectively\n\
    will cause all your data to be lost.

Errors.JRE_Requirement_Title_FMT=JRE {0} Required
Errors.JRE_Requirement_Message_FMT=\
    You need to upgrade your Java Runtime Environment!  This\n\
    version of the Process Dashboard requires version {2} or\n\
    higher of the Java Runtime Environment.  You are currently\n\
    running Java Runtime Environment version {0}.\n\
\       To download an updated version of the Java Runtime\n\
    Environment, visit   {1}.

Errors.Unexpected_Error_Title=\
    Process Dashboard - Unexpected Problem During Startup
Errors.Unexpected_Error_Message=\
    The Process Dashboard encountered an unexpected problem and was unable\n\
    to start.  Please contact the Process Dashboard development team at\n\
\               processdash-devel@lists.sourceforge.net\n\
    and give them the error trace below, so they can address the problem in an\n\
    upcoming release.
Errors.Unexpected_Error_Trace_Prompt=\
    Error Trace:        <a>Copy to Clipboard</a>


Errors.Broken_Data_Title=Missing Data Files
Errors.Broken_Data_Header=\
	Missing files are preventing the dashboard from opening the\n\
	data for the following projects/tasks\:
Errors.Broken_Data_Footer=\
	The most likely cause of this problem is that you created\n\
	the above projects/tasks based on an add-on process set,\n\
	then deleted the file containing that add-on process set.\n\
	If you use add-on process sets located in a network directory,\n\
	this problem could also occur when the network is unavailable.\n\
	The recommended course of action is to shut down the\n\
	dashboard, reinstall the add-on process set, then restart the\n\
	dashboard.  Until you do this, the data for these\n\
	projects/tasks will be inaccessible and/or incomplete.

Errors.Read_File_Error.Title=Cannot Open Data Files
Errors.Read_File_Error.Message_FMT=\
    The dashboard was unable to open and read {0}:\n        \
        {1}\n\
    \ \n\
    This problem could be caused by insufficient file permissions,\n\
    intermittent network problems, or other filesystem errors. To\n\
    prevent data loss/corruption, the dashboard must exit.
Errors.Read_File_Error.Time_Log=the file containing\nyour time log

Errors.Save_Error.Title=Cannot Save Data Files
Errors.Save_Error.Message_FMT=\
	The dashboard was unable to save the following data:\n        \
        {0} \n\
	This problem could be caused by insufficient file permissions,\n\
	intermittent network problems, or other filesystem errors.  If\n\
	you leave the dashboard running, it will continue trying to save\n\
	this information.  If you shut down the dashboard now, this data\n\
	will be permanently lost.\n\
	\ \n\
	Are you certain you want to shut down the dashboard, and lose\n\
	this data?
Errors.Save_Error.Remote_Message=\
	The dashboard was unable to contact the server to save your recent\n\
	changes.  This problem could be caused by intermittent network\n\
	connectivity or other communications problems.\n\
	\ \n\
	If you leave the dashboard running, it will continue trying to save\n\
	this information.  If you shut down the dashboard now, your changes\n\
	will be permanently lost.\n\
	\ \n\
	Are you certain you want to shut down the dashboard, and lose\n\
	your recent changes?

Errors.Lost_Lock.Title=Network Connectivity Problems
Errors.Lost_Lock.Opening_Message=\
	Although you opened the dashboard in read-write mode, your\n\
	connection to the network was broken, and your lock on the data\n\
	was lost.  In the meantime, another individual has opened this\n\
	dataset for editing, so your lock could not be reclaimed.
Errors.Lost_Lock.Ongoing_Advice=\
	As a result, recent changes you have made (and any changes you\n\
	continue to make while you have this dashboard open) cannot be\n\
	saved.  You are strongly encouraged to close and reopen the\n\
	dashboard.
Errors.Lost_Lock.Shutdown_Warning=\
	As a result, recent changes you have made cannot be saved.  The\n\
	dashboard will now exit.

# properties for read-only startup

ReadOnly.Recommended.Title=Read Only Mode Recommended
ReadOnly.Recommended.Message=\
    This dashboard instance is used by many people.\n\
    If you only intend to view data (not modify\n\
    anything), you should open the dashboard in\n\
    read-only mode, so others can make changes.
ReadOnly.Recommended.Read_Only_Option=Open in read-only mode
ReadOnly.Recommended.Read_Write_Option=Open in read-write mode
ReadOnly.Title_FMT={0} (Read Only)
ReadOnly.Error.Title=Error: Read-Only Mode
ReadOnly.Error.Message=\
    This feature is not available, because the dashboard is currently \
    operating in read-only mode.
ReadOnly.File_Permissions.Title=Cannot Modify Data Files
ReadOnly.File_Permissions.Message_FMT=\
    The Process Dashboard needs to read and write to files\n\
    located at:\n\
    \        {0}\n\
    \ \n\
    Unfortunately, <a>some of these files</a> are read-only.  This\n\
    might have occurred if you manually altered the files in\n\
    that directory (for example, by restoring from a backup),\n\
    or if files in that directory belong to another user.\n\
    \ \n\
    Since some dashboard data files are not writable, the\n\
    dashboard cannot start normally. If you would like to view\n\
    the data read-only, click OK.  Otherwise, click Cancel,\n\
    resolve the file permissions problem, and start the\n\
    dashboard again.
ReadOnly.Cannot_Lock.Title=Cannot Lock Data Files
ReadOnly.Cannot_Lock.Message_FMT=\
    The Process Dashboard needs to obtain a lock on data files\n\
    located at:\n\
    \        {0}\n\
    \ \n\
    Unfortunately, your operating system <a>was unable</a> to secure\n\
    a lock on those files.  This is an unusual situation,\n\
    possibly caused by the current configuration of the remote\n\
    network directory.\n\
    \ \n\
    Since the files could not be locked, the dashboard has no\n\
    way of saving changes while still ensuring the integrity of\n\
    the data.  If you would like to view the data read-only,\n\
    click OK.  Otherwise, click Cancel, work with your network\n\
    administrator to troubleshoot the locking problem, and start\n\
    the dashboard again.
