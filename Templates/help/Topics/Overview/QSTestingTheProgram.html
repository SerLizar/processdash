<p>When using the PSP, you should strive to remove defects before the
testing phase whenever possible.  Nevertheless, you will still encounter
defects during testing, and you should log these defects using the defect
button. Since we have already seen an entry of a defect, we will take this
opportunity to look at a more complicated situation.</p>

<P>Consider the following circumstance: while testing, you find a defect
and put in a fix.  Upon compiling your fix you discover that you have
inadvertently injected another defect (perhaps a syntax error in your
coding).  This is what the PSP calls a "fix defect" - a defect injected
while entering a fix for another defect.</p>

<P>The dashboard has a very handy feature to help in this regard.  While the 
defect dialog for one defect is open, you can click on the little defect 
button in the corner to enter a new defect for the fix of the current 
defect.</p>

<P>After clicking the Fix Defect button, a new defect dialog will open for 
entry of data for this new defect.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/QSTwoDefectDialogs.png"></p>

<P>While this new defect dialog is open, the timer for the previous defect 
dialog is paused.  Also, notice that the number of the previous defect is 
already entered in the Fix Defect blank.  Once the information for this new 
defect is entered and the user clicks OK, the previous defect dialog will pop 
to the front of the screen and the timer will resume.  For more information 
about this behavior, see the <a 
href="../Execution/EnteringDefects.html">Entering Defects</a> help topic.</p>

<P>Back to our example.  Once the program has been sufficiently tested and 
all the defects have been entered, hit the completion checkbox again to move 
into Postmortem.</p>
