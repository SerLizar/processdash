<p>Dear David:</p>

<p>Whereas you wish to make freely available a tool for metrics
collection and process automation, whereas you wish to make freely
available one or more &quot;add-on&quot; modules for this tool
intended to support the Personal Software Process<sup>SM</sup>, and
whereas you wish to include in the &quot;add-on&quot; modules
materials from Appendix C of <i>A&nbsp;Discipline for Software
Engineering</i>, by Watts S. Humphrey, as are specified in 
<a href="RequestLetter.html">your letter of March 7, 2002</a>, then
permission to include those materials in the &quot;add-on&quot;
modules is hereby granted, free of charge, subject to the following
terms and conditions, and subject to withdrawal if these terms and
conditions are not met:</p>

<ol>

<li>The &quot;add-on&quot; modules may be made freely available on the
Web or on CD-ROM, but may not be sold or offered for sale</li>

<li>The following notices must be prominently displayed with the
&quot;add-on&quot; modules, as well as in any presentation of
them:

    <blockquote>&quot;This module incorporates templates, scripts, and
    other materials from the book by Watts S. Humphrey, A Discipline
    for Software Engineering. Copyright &copy; 1995 by
    Addison-Wesley. These materials are reproduced with the permission
    of the publisher.&quot;</blockquote></li>

<li>The following statement must be prominently displayed with the
&quot;add-on&quot; modules, as a license that users must agree to
before downloading or installing them:

    <blockquote>&quot;Although I understand that I may use the
    Personal Software Process<sup>SM</sup> (PSP<sup>SM</sup>)
    materials provided in this Dashboard module, I will not copy,
    modify, or distribute these materials without first obtaining
    written permission from Addison-Wesley.  I understand that I may
    use the materials in this module in conjunction with the Process
    Dashboard tool, but I may not use them for other purposes without
    first obtaining written permission from Addison-Wesley.
    Furthermore, I will not represent myself as using the PSP process
    unless I have been trained to do so by an SEI-authorized PSP
    instructor.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>The PSP was developed by Watts S. Humphrey and is
    described in his book, <i>A&nbsp;Discipline for Software
    Engineering</i>.  The PSP provides a powerful way to develop
    software, but it is effective only if properly used. While this
    module aids trained professionals in applying the PSP methods, it
    does not provide instruction on how to use the PSP.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>Personal Software Process and PSP are service marks of
    Carnegie Mellon University.&quot;</blockquote></li>

</ol>

<p>Sincerely,<br></p>
