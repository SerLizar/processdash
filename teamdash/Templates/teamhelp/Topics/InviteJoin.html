<h1>Invite Team Members to Join Team Project (Team Leader)</h1>

<p>The dashboard takes a wholistic view of team and personal data.  It
assumes that teams and individuals will participate in many projects,
and that these many-to-many relationships will change over time.  So
to establish these relationships, each team member must "join" the
team project.</p>

<p>After creating a team project, the team leader should invite all
team members to join the new project. For teams using the dashboard
for the first time, it is wise to perform this step before the project
launch.  Joining the project helps to ensure that everyone has
successfully installed the software, and that no network communication
problems exist.  Performing this step before the launch gives you time
to work through any problems that might arise.</p>

<p>Before following the instructions below, you must have already
(a)&nbsp;installed the Process Dashboard with Team Features, and
(b)&nbsp;created a team project.</p>

<ol>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>If the Team Dashboard
is not already running, start it using the appropriately named
shortcut on the team leader's computer. </li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>In the Team Dashboard window, use the
Hierarchy Menus to navigate to your team project. Click the script button
and select the "Team Project Tools" option from the menu that appears.

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/team-scripts-tools.png"></p></li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>Scroll to the bottom
of the page. You will notice a section that reads,

<div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-left: 1cm; font-family: sans-serif">

<p>Team members can join this project by pointing their web browser to:<br>

<u><span style='color:blue'>http://XXXXX:3000/Project/Team+Project//PDSSD/setup/join.shtm</span></u></p>

<p>To make it easy for individual team members to join this project,
you can <u><span style='color:blue'>click on this link</span></u> to
send them an email with instructions.</p>

</div></li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>As instructed, click
on the second link to send email to project team members. A draft
email message will be constructed, ready for you to address and
send.<br><br>

When team members receive your email and join the project, they will
be asked to provide their initials. To avoid problems later, you might
consider adding a paragraph to the beginning of this email message
telling each individual what initials they should use. Then send the
message to each team member.<br><br>

If you are on a computer/network where email is not available, you can
manually write down the URL displayed in the first hyperlink and
communicate that URL to each team member. They simply need to open
that URL in a Web browser and follow the instructions.</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'><i>Leave the Team
Dashboard program running to allow team members to join</i>. If you
shut down the Team Dashboard, team members will be unable to join the
project.</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>As the team leader, you could very
possibly perform some tasks in support of project work. If so, you too
should personally follow the steps to join the project. To do this,
complete the following:

    <ul>

    <li>Launch your <i>personal</i> Process Dashboard dataset and
    leave it running</li>

    <li>Point your Web browser at the same URL (described above) that
    your team members are using to join the project.</li>

    </ul>

</li>

</ol>

<p>The steps above should work for most organizations.  But in others,
firewalls or other network configurations may cause individuals to
receive a "Server Not Found" error when they attempt to join the team
project.  If this occurs for your team, follow the instructions in the
<a href="NetworkTroubleshooting.html">network troubleshooting</a> help
topic.</p>
