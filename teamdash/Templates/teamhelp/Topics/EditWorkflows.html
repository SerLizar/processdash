<h1>Plan Project Development Process</h1>
<b>(TSP Launch Meeting No. 3)</b>

<p>In the next step of the project launch process, the team typically
formalizes the steps in their development process. To do this, you may
draw upon existing organizational processes, or you may define new
processes as a team during the launch. The team may create defined
processes, or they may simply identify common, repeatable workflows.
The Process Dashboard provides tools that assist with this task.</p>

<p>If your team is defining new processes from scratch, it is often a
good idea to use a whiteboard, easel, and other traditional meeting
aids to capture the team's ideas, as this helps to promote the free
flow of ideas. When the team processes begin to solidify, it is
helpful to have an individual enter these into the dashboard. (On the
other hand, if your process definitions take a long time to solidify,
it may be more helpful to wait until after the meeting is over to
enter the process steps into the dashboard.)</p>

<p>Processes and workflows are entered into the Common Team Workflows
Editor. From the Work Breakdown Structure Editor window, you can
access the Common Team Workflows Editor by selecting the Workflow menu
and choosing Edit Workflows.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/workflows-empty.png"></p>

<p>Processes and workflows are once again displayed hierarchically and
edited in an outline format. (For more in-depth information on editing
this outline, see the <a href="EditingTheWBS.html">Editing the Work
Breakdown Structure</a> help topic.) In this hierarchical outline,
each item that is a direct child of the Common Workflows node
represents a single <i>process</i> or <i>workflow</i>.  These items
are displayed with an icon depicting a structured bundle (<img
border=0 width=15 height=15 src="../Images/icon-process.png">).  You
can designate a given node as a process or workflow by un-indenting it
as far to the left as possible.</p>

<p>Define the steps in a process or workflow by creating items
hierarchically underneath it. Underneath a process or workflow, you
can define documents that will be created and tasks that will be
performed. To define the type of each item you create, click on its
icon to display a menu. When defining a high-maturity process, make
certain to select the most appropriate process phase for each task you
create.</p>

<p>When defining the various tasks in a workflow, you have the option
of choosing a "PSP Task."  This is recommended as a best practice.
PSP Tasks items will be translated into PSP2.1 projects in an
individual's personal plan.  This enables the individual to draw upon
their personal historical data (using tools such as PROBE) to refine
their plan.  This provides a bridge between <b>team</b> historical
data (which your team should use to assign percentages to the various
tasks in the workflow), and <b>personal</b> historical data (which
will be used to distribute time across the various phases of the PSP
Task within their personal plan).</p>

<p>Since a PSP Task represents all of the tasks in the PSP2.1 process,
you do not need to explicitly add the PSP2.1 phases (Design, Design
Review, Code, Code Review, Compile, Test) in places where you have
added a PSP Task.  However, you <u>do</u> need to add tasks for Design
Inspection and Code Inspection.  These tasks should immediately follow
the PSP Task in your workflow.  When you follow this pattern, the
inspection tasks will automatically be inserted into the correct order
between the phases of the PSP Task in the individual's "Flat View"
task list.</p>


<p>You are not limited in the number of processes/workflows you can
create. Each process/workflow, however, should be given a unique
name.</p>

<p>The five columns on the right are completely optional, but entering
data can save you a great deal of time later.</p>

<ul>

<li style='margin-top:9pt'><a name="pct"></a>The % column provides a
convenient way to divide a larger task proportionately. Your team may
have historical data that tells you the typical amount of time that is
spent during each step of this workflow.  If you do not have
historical data, your team may wish to estimate these percentages
during the launch.  Either way, you can use the %&nbsp;column to
designate that breakdown, as shown in the following example:

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/workflow-percentage-example.png"></p>

<p>When you apply this workflow to a component in your team project,
the WBS Editor will look at the time you have estimated for that
component, and subdivide the time based upon the percentages you have
entered.</p></li>


<li style='margin-top:9pt'><a name="rate"></a>The Rate and Units
columns are also optional.  If you happen to know the typical
productivity rates (based on historical or estimated team averages)
for <u>all</u> the tasks in a workflow, you can enter those rates in
this column.  For example, you might wish to state that a Code Review
task takes place at a rate of 200 LOC/Hr, or that a PSP Task completes
at a rate of 20 LOC/Hr.  Here is an example for a possible team
software development process:

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/workflow-rate-example.png"></p>

<p>When you apply this workflow to a component in your team project,
the WBS Editor will look at the estimated size for the component.  It
will use that size, along with the percentages and productivity rates
you have entered, to generate an effort estimate for each task in the
component.</p>

<p>An astute observer will notice that this behavior differs from the
"percentage-only" behavior described in the bullet above.  This is a
very important consideration.  When you examine a single team
workflow, if <u>any</u> task has a number in the Rate column, the
workflow will use size estimates to produce time/effort estimates.  If
<u>no</u> rates are present, the workflow will let you enter a
top-level time estimate, then use the percentages to spread the time
across the tasks.  You should decide which mode you wish to use for
each workflow, then either (a)&nbsp;leave the rate column blank, or
(b)&nbsp;enter rates for every task.</p></li>


<li style='margin-top:9pt'>The # People column allows you to indicate
that a particular task is generally performed by a group of
individuals. For example, if you create a Peer Review task in your
process, you might wish to indicate that five people typically
participate in a Peer Review.

<p>When a task in a workflow is performed by more than one person,
effort estimates will be generated differently based on the presence
of a value in the "%" column.  If you have placed a number in the "%"
column, the WBS will understand that this task is a percentage of an
overall workflow; so that percentage describes the total amount of
work that will be spread across those individuals.  If you leave the
"%" column blank and enter a Rate, the WBS will understand that each
individual is independently working at that rate.</p>

<p>An example illustrates this best.  When you examine the "Simple
Process" workflow above, three individuals will be working on the
"Code Inspection" task.  That task has been described as a task that
requires "200 LOC/Hr".  So if you apply this workflow to a component
that has 400 LOC, three people will be working on this task, and each
one will spend two hours.  In contrast, the "Integration Test" task
has been described as being 12% of a workflow that requires 10 LOC/Hr.
For a 400 LOC component, that end-to-end workflow will take 40 hours.
12% of 40 hours is 4.8 hours, so this is the total time that will be
allocated to the "Integration Test" task.  Three people are assigned,
and the time will be spread across them equally, so each one will
spend 1.6 hours.</p></li>

<li>The Script URLs column allows you to attach process scripts and
other aids to the elements in a workflow. (<b>But please note:</b> the
Script URLs column will <u>only</u> appear if you created this Team
Project using Process Dashboard version 1.12 or higher.)

<p>For example, you may have a web page on an organizational process
library or a team wiki that publishes instructions for a given
workflow, and provides links to helpful forms, checklists, templates,
etc. You can enter the <tt>http</tt> URL of that web page in this
column, and the page will appear in the Process Dashboard's script
menu when an individual performs the associated task.</p>

<p>You can attach URLs to an overall workflow and/or to specific
tasks within a workflow. You can enter multiple URLs for a single row;
just separate them with spaces (for example, "http://www.google.com/
http://www.yahoo.com/"). If you wish to customize the text that
appears in the dashboard's Script Menu, just put a space and the
desired text immediately after a particular URL (for example,
"http://www.google.com/ Corporate Help Desk").</p></li>

</ul>


<p>There is not a Save button on the Common Team Workflows
Editor. Instead, workflow definitions are automatically saved when you
save the main work breakdown structure. To save, switch back to the
main Work Breakdown Structure Editor window and select Save from the
File menu.</p>


<p>Two buttons on the toolbar provide the ability to import (<img
border=0 width=61 height=28 src="../Images/workflow-import-button.png">) and
export (<img border=0 width=61 height=28
src="../Images/workflow-export-button.png">) workflows. This makes it
possible to share workflows between projects and between project
teams. When you click one of these buttons, the workflow editor will
ask you to identify the name of a workflow library file. You can
export workflows to a new or existing library file, or import
workflows from an existing file. After choosing a file, the
Import/Export Team Workflows window will appear. This window shows the
workflows from the current project in a table on the left, and the
workflows from the library in a table on the right.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/workflow-import-export-dialog.png"></p>

<p>When exporting, you can select a workflow in the table on the left
and click the Add button to export it to the library on the
right. When importing, you can select a workflow in the library table
on the right and click the Add button to import it to the project
workflows on the left.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/workflow-import-add-example.png"></p>

<p>Workflows are identified by their names (for example, &quot;Simple
Process&quot; in the image below). If you import or export a
workflow which has the same name as an existing workflow in the
destination table, the existing workflow will be overwritten. For
example, in the image below, the user is importing workflows from an
existing library.  They have selected the &quot;Simple
Process&quot; workflow in the library on the right. Since there is
already a workflow by that name in the project workflow list on the
left, the application has automatically highlighted it, and changed
the text on the Add button to &quot;Overwrite,&quot; indicating that
if this workflow is imported it will overwrite the workflow that is
highlighted on the left.</p>

<p class="figure"><img
   src="../Images/workflow-import-overwrite-example.png"></p>

<p>At times, you may wish to import all the workflows in a library, or
export all of the workflows in your project. The Add All button will
perform this task. Keep in mind that any existing workflows with the
same names will be overwritten, as described in the paragraph
above.</p>

<p>The changes you make in the Import/Export Team Workflows window
will not be saved until you click the Import or Export button at the
bottom of the window. (Only one of these buttons will appear,
depending on whether you chose to import workflows or export
workflows.) When you click the Export button, the changes you made to
the workflow library will be saved to the named file. When you click
the Import button, the changes you made to the project workflows will
be applied to the contents of the Common Team Workflows Editor. When
importing or exporting, if you make a mistake or change your mind,
just click the Cancel button and no changes will be saved.</p>
