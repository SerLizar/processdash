<H1>Overview</H1>
<P>We feel that the PSP and the TSP are remarkable technologies that can change 
the face of the software industry, and we share the SEI's zeal to promote their 
widespread use. We feel that a freely available, powerful support tool could 
help to remove one of the most significant barriers to PSP / TSP adoption. We 
therefore aim to develop a world-class tool under the open-source model, and 
distribute it freely to anyone using the PSP and/or TSP. We feel that this is 
the least we can do to thank the SEI for developing and distributing these 
remarkable processes. </P>
<H2>What is the PSP<SUP>(SM)</SUP>?</H2>
<P>The <A target=_top href="http://www.sei.cmu.edu/tsp">Personal Software 
Process<SUP>(SM)</SUP></A>, created by Watts Humprey of the Software Engineering 
Institute, introduces software engineers to a disciplined process for software 
engineering. Engineers using the PSP to develop software follow defined 
processes and collect detailed metrics on the time required to produce a 
product, the defects that were injected and removed at various stages in 
development, and the size of the finished product.</P>
<P>These metrics are then analyzed using statistical methods, enabling engineers 
to produce highly accurate estimates based on historical data, track progress 
and quality of a project in progress, predict schedule impacts, and predict the 
quality of a finished software product. The PSP encourages engineers to 
quantitatively determine ways to improve their process.</P>

<H2>What is the TSP<SUP>(SM)</SUP>?</H2>
<P>The <A target=_top href="http://www.sei.cmu.edu/tsp">Team Software 
Process<SUP>(SM)</SUP></A>, also created by Watts Humphrey, is a process 
framework for teams of PSP-trained engineers. The TSP scales well and can be 
used by teams of 3 to 20 people to develop software products of significant size 
and complexity.</P>
<P>Teams of engineers using both the PSP and the TSP to develop software have 
consistently observed remarkable improvements in their work:</P>

        released software. 
        <LI>Schedule estimates accurate to within 10% (4% error on average) 
      </LI></UL>
      <H2>Why build a tool?</H2>
      <P>Both the PSP and the TSP require the collection and analysis of metrics 
      at a <I>very</I> fine-grained level. Further, TSP requires teams to 
      roll-up individual metrics to produce team metrics. Once data are 
      collected at this level, statistical analyses of the data permit 
      remarkable planning, tracking, prediction, and control of software 
      products and projects.</P>
      <P>These metrics collection and analysis processes, however, are not 
      trivial. In any real-world project, tool support for the PSP and TSP 
      become important considerations. Although studies have demonstrated that 
      people <U>can</U> maintain their productivity when using the PSP 
      <I>without</I> tool support, the "frustration factor" inherent with such 
      an approach tries the patience of all but the most disciplined engineers, 
      making PSP behaviors difficult to sustain.</P>
      <P>Ideally, PSP/TSP practitioners would like to have a support tool 
      that:</P>

              easily, with minimal frustration.

              <LI>Allows data at the individual level to be rolled up to produce 
              team-level or organizational-level metrics.

              people from seeing or using their data. 
              <LI>Supports powerful analyses of data at the individual, team, 
              organizational, and enterprise levels, and allows existing
