<h1>Editing Preferences</h1>

<p>The Preferences Editor allows you to alter configuration settings that
affect the appearance and behavior of the Process Dashboard.  You can open
the Preferences Editor by selecting "Preferences" from the &quot;C&nbsp;<img
border="0" src="../../Images/rarrow.png" width="12"
height="9">&nbsp;Tools&quot; menu.</p>

<p>Common preferences are displayed in several categories.</p>

<h2>User Interface</h2>

<p><a name="windowTitle"></a><b>Window Title</b>: this field allows you to
change the title that appears on the main Process Dashboard toolbar.  If you
regularly work with more than one Process Dashboard dataset, changing the
title of each window can make it easier to tell the datasets apart.</p>

<p><a name="windowTitleInclude"></a><b>Include in Title</b>: in the personal
dashboard, these elements give the option to display dynamic timing metrics in
the main window title bar.</p>

<p><a name="alwaysOnTop"></a><b>Always On Top</b>: If you are running Java 1.6
or higher, this setting will appear, allowing you to request that the Process
Dashboard toolbar remain on top of other windows.</p>

<p><a name="systemTray"></a><b>System Tray</b>: If you are running Java 1.6
or higher, the dashboard can display an icon in the
<a href="../Execution/SystemTray.html">system tray</a>.  A checkbox
here allows you to enable or disable this feature.  If this feature is
enabled, you can also choose how the Process Dashboard should behave when you
minimize the main window.  If you put a check in the "Minimize to system
tray" checkbox, minimizing the dashboard will remove the entry from your
application task bar, leaving only the system tray icon.  In this mode,
double-clicking on the system tray icon will bring the window back.</p>

<p><a name="i18nLevel"></a><b>Translation Support</b>: If your operating
system is configured to use a language other than English, and if you (or
others) have <a href="LocalizationTool.html">entered translations</a> for
that language, then the Process Dashboard may be able to display some
messages in your language. Here, you can configure the extent to which
messages will be translated:</p>

    <ul>

    <li><b>Disabled</b> - US English will be used for all user interface
        components, messages, reports, charts, and date/number formats.</li>

    <li><b>Low</b> - English will be used for <i>most</i> user interface
        components, messages, reports, and charts.  Dates and numbers will
        be formatted according to the operating system locale.</li>

    <li><b>Medium</b> - User interface components and messages will be
        displayed in your language whenever translations are available, as
        will some charts and reports.</li>

    <li><b>High</b> - The dashboard will also attempt to translate the names
        of process metrics into your language.</li>

    </ul>

<p><a name="largeFonts"></a><b>Use large fonts</b>: On some systems, it is
possible to increase the size of the fonts used in the application.  Checking
this box will increase the sizes of many fonts, which can make the user
interface easier to read on high-resolution displays.  (Unfortunately,
limitatations in the Java platform prevent some font sizes from changing.)</p>

<p><a name="scriptMenuDefault"></a><b>Click on script menu</b>: When you click
on the script button, it will normally open the script menu.  If you would
prefer for it to open the default script/form for the current task instead,
you can check this box.</p>


<h2><a name="addOns"></a>Add-ons</h2>

<p>The Process Dashboard can read process templates, scripts, tools,
extensions, and other modules from various locations.  By default, it
will find any modules that are placed in the directory where you
installed the dashboard.  If you and your team members want to use a
<a href="ProcessDefinition/HowDashboardFindsFiles.html">shared network
area</a> for Process Dashboard scripts and templates, you can configure that
area on this panel.  Just ensure that the check box is enabled, and click the
"Add" button to add a new template location.</p>

<p>You may have entries in this list that are related to team projects you
have joined in the past.  If some of the entries are out of date or describe
nonexistent network directories, you can remove them from the list.</p>

<p>If your team is not actively using this feature and your organization's
network is slow, you may wish to disable this feature entirely.  Just uncheck
the box on this panel.  However, if you receive an error message the next
time the dashboard starts, it may be necessary to reenable this feature.</p>

<h2><a name="backups"></a>Backups</h2>

<p>The dashboard automatically keeps internal backups of data.  On this
panel, you can configure how many days worth of backup data should be kept.
These internal backups are incremental, so they do not take up much space.
As a result, the default value (six weeks) is fairly helpful.</p>

<p>In addition, you can ask the dashboard to make redundant external backups
to one or more locations.  Just add entries to the table on this preferences
panel.</p>

<p>For more information about internal and external backups, see the
<a href="BackupData.html">data backup</a> help topic.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

<p><a name="readOnlyRecommend"></a><b>Recommend read-only</b>: Sometimes a
Team Dashboard is shared by many people who routinely open it.  Most of the
time, these people may just need to view rolled up team reports.  However,
the act of opening the dashboard causes the data to be locked; then, another
individual who really needs to make changes is told that the data is in use
by someone else.  To help with this problem, you can check this box for
heavily shared team dashboards.  Then, each time an individual opens this
dashboard, they will see a prompt asking them if they need read access or if
they just need to view reports.  This allows the "report-only" individuals
to open the dashboard without locking it, leaving the lock available to
others who need to make changes.</p>

<p><a name="autoUpdate"></a><b>Check for updated software</b>: The
dashboard can perform a monthly check to see if a new version of the software
is available.  If you do not want it to look for updates, remove the
checkmark from this box.</p>

<p><a name="slowNetwork"></a><b>Slow network</b>: If your organization has an
unusually slow network, or if you connect to team resources over a VPN, you
can check this box.  The dashboard will optimize some internal operations
differently in an attempt to improve performance.</p>

<p><a name="numericIPs"></a><b>Numeric IP</b>: The Process Dashboard displays
some resources in your web browser.  Most of the time, these pages are on the
same computer where the dashboard is running.  But in a small number of
special cases, the dashboard is running on one computer and it displays a URL
that you can use from another computer.  The most common scenario for this is
the Team Project Tools page in the Team Dashboard; it displays
URLs that you can share with other people so they can join the project or
view the plan summary.  By default, it will use the name of the hosting
computer to build these "shareable" URLs.  But if your organization's network
is not configured to register these names in DNS, other individuals may find
that the URLs don't work.  In that case, you can put a check mark in this
box, and the dashboard will use the IP address of the hosting computer
(instead of its name) to build the shareable URLs.</p>

<h2><a name="advanced"></a>Advanced</h2>

<p>The categories listed above provide access to the most commonly used
dashboard settings.  However, the dashboard has an extensive collection of
other, infrequently used settings.  If you need to change one of those other
settings, you can add entries to the table on this panel.</p>

<a href="ConfigurationFile.html">advanced settings</a> help topic.</p>
