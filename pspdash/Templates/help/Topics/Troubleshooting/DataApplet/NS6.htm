<H1>Problem with browser</H1>

<P>We're sorry, but Netscape 6 and higher is not currently capable of
supporting the dashboard's data integration features.

<P>The dashboard <b>can</b> integrate with the following browsers:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.htm">Internet
    Explorer</a> 4.0 or greater <i>(on Windows systems only)</i>
<li><a href="http://home.netscape.com/download/archive.html">Netscape 4.7</a>
</ul>

<p>You can still keep using Netscape 6 or higher as your
system-default web browser, and use a different web browser with the
dashboard.  Visit the 
<a href="http://processdash.sourceforge.net/custom_windows_installation.html">Process
Dashboard website</a> for instructions.
