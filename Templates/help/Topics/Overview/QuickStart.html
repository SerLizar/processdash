<p>This "Quick Start" example is provided to illustrate the most
commonly used features in the Process Dashboard, and walk you through
their use on a typical project.  PSP2.1 is used for this example,
because most PSP-trained engineers will choose to use PSP2.1 for their
daily work.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 1cm">

<p><b>Note</b>: The PSP2.1 process helps developers improve the quality of
their plans by analyzing data from previously completed projects.  To
illustrate how this functionality works in the Process Dashboard, the
following quick start example illustrates dashboard behavior for a user who
has already completed several historical projects.</p>

<p>When you first begin using the dashboard, you won't have any historical
project data in the dashboard.  As a result, brand new users of the dashboard
should not expect to be able to follow these steps verbatim and see the same
results.  (For example, the PROBE wizard will behave very differently for an
individual with no historical data.)</p>

<p>If you have been using PSP for some time, you may be able to use the
<a href="../PostmortemAnalysis/ExportingData.html#importPSP">&quot;PSP
Data Import&quot; template</a> to enter your 
historical data into the dashboard.  This is not strictly required, but it
can help you to benefit immediately from the wealth of historical data you
have collected in the past.</p>

<p>If you have never used PSP before, you are strongly encouraged to use the
PSP0 process for your first project, and the PSP0.1 process for your second
and third projects. You should also take a PSP course to learn how to use the
PSP processes.</p>
