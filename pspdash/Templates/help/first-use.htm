<p><B><I>Thank you for using the </I><U>Process Dashboard!</U></B></p>

<p>If this is your first time to run the dashboard, you might benefit from the
<a href="http://processdash.sourceforge.net/pspdash/quickstart.html">quick
start guide</a>, which provides a quick walkthrough of dashboard usage.</p>

<p>The first step to using the dashboard is to create a hierarchical work
breakdown structure describing the work you do.  To create this hierarchy,
follow these steps: <ol>

   <li>On the main dashboard window, click the "C" Menu, and choose
       "Hierarchy".  The Hierarchy Editor window will appear.<BR>&nbsp;

   <li>Build your hierarchy using commands in the "Edit" menu.  Your hierarchy
       can be built from
       <ul>
       <li>"Nodes" (which are like folders on your hard drive) and
       <li>Templates (which are defined processes for completing a task - for
       example, PSP2.1).
       </ul>
       In general, you will want to create a hierarchy of Nodes describing the
       various projects/subprojects you support, then add templates underneath
       these nodes describing the lowest-level tasks to be done.<BR>&nbsp;

   <li>You don't have to create your complete work breakdown structure right
       now - you can always come back and add nodes and templates to your
       hierarchy later.  When you have finished editing your hierarchy, choose
       "Save" from the "File" menu.

</ol></p>
