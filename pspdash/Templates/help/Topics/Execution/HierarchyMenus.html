<H1>Navigating the hierarchy menus</H1>

<P>The dashboard attempts to keep itself as small as possible to allow the bulk 
of precious screen real estate to be used for the actual business of software 
development.  As different sections of the project tree are selected via the 
hierarchy menus, the dashboard will automatically resize itself to accomodate 
the menu depth necessary to show the chosen process phase.</P>

<P>The hierarchy menus are the way you choose the current working project.  
This example shows the dashboard ready to work on the Design phase of a 
PSP0 project.  The hierarchy menus show each level in the current project 
tree all the way down to the current phase.</P>

<P>To better illustrate navigation with the hierarchy menus, this fake set of 
projects will be used.  The project tree is shown in a screenshot from the 
hierarchy editor.  For more information on putting together a project 
hierarchy and the use of the hierarchy editor see the <a 
href="../Planning/UsingHierarchyEditor.html">Using the hierarchy editor</a> 
help topic.</P>

<P>This project hierarchy shows two top level project categories: "Project" 
and "Non Project".  These are the two categories given as default when the 
dashboard is first run.  Under "Project" there are three projects defined: 
"PSP0" and "Web project" along with a hierarchy node: "Palm".  Presumably 
this developer will be doing several projects in the future that fall under 
the logical category of "Palm".  At this point only one is shown: "Palm 
DB".  In this screenshot, only the Web project has been expanded to show its 
phases.  Phases are added into the project hierarchy as children of a 
project.  Web project was created from a PSP2.1 template, and so it has all 
the development phases of a PSP2.1 project.</P>

<P>Back on the dashboard itself, when the first hierarchy menu is selected, 
it will show all the entries in the project hierarchy that are defined at 
that level.  In this case it shows the two default nodes "Project" and "Non 
Project".</P>

<P>Selecting the second hierarchy menu shows the entries defined at that 
level under the selection from the first menu.  In this case, the user has 
selected "Project" on the first menu, so the second menu shows the children 
of "Project" in the project hierarchy.</p>

<P>Selecting any menu in the set of hierarchy menus will show the entries 
defined as children under the selection on the menu to its left.  This final 
example shows the PSP 2.1 process phases that are defined for the "Web 
project".</p>
