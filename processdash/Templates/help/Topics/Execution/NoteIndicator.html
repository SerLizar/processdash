<h1>The Task Note Indicator</h1>

<p>Notes and comments can be attached to any project or task in the
dashboard.  To create, view, or edit these notes, click the note indicator
icon near the right edge of the main dashboard toolbar.</p>

<p>The Task Comment Editor window will appear.</p>

<p>This window displays your project/task hierarchy on the left.  Click a
particular project, component, or task to create, view, or edit the
associated note.  To delete a note, simply delete all the text in the note,
then save the changes.</p>

<p>When a note is associated with the currently active task (or any of its
hierarchical parents), the note indicator on the main dashboard toolbar
will turn yellow, and the tooltip will provide the text of the note.</p>

<p>If you attach a note to a component or task within a team project, that
note will be shared with other members of the team project when you perform
a "Sync to WBS" operation.</p>
