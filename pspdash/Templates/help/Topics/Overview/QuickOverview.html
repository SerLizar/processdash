<H1>Quick Overview</H1>
<P>We feel that the PSP and the TSP are remarkable 
technologies that can change the face of the software industry, and we share the 
SEI's zeal to promote their widespread use. We feel that a freely available, 
powerful support tool could help to remove one of the most significant barriers 
to PSP / TSP adoption. We therefore aim to develop a world-class tool under the 
open-source model, and distribute it freely to anyone using the PSP and/or TSP. 
We feel that this is the least we can do to thank the SEI for developing and 
distributing these remarkable processes. </P>
<H2>What&nbsp;are the PSP<SUP>(SM)</SUP> and the 
TSP<SUP>(SM)</SUP>?</H2>
<P>The <A target=_top href="http://www.sei.cmu.edu/tsp">Personal Software Process<SUP>(SM)</SUP></A> and the <A target=_top 
href="http://www.sei.cmu.edu/tsp">Team Software Process<SUP>(SM)</SUP></A>, both 
created by Watts Humprey of the Software Engineering Institute, introduces 
software engineers to a disciplined process for software engineering. Engineers 
using the PSP to develop software follow defined processes and collect detailed 
metrics on the time required to produce a product, the 
defects that were injected and removed at various stages 
in development, and the size of the finished product.&nbsp; The TSP 
is a process framework for teams of PSP-trained engineers. The TSP scales well 
and can be used by teams of 3 to 20 people to 
develop software products of significant size and complexity.</P>
<P>These metrics are then analyzed using statistical 
methods, enabling engineers to produce highly accurate estimates based on 
historical data, track progress and quality of a project in progress, predict 
schedule impacts, and predict the quality of a finished software product. The 
PSP encourages engineers to quantitatively determine ways to improve their 
process.</P>
<P>Teams of engineers using both the PSP and the TSP to develop software have 
consistently observed remarkable improvements in their work:</P>

<H2>Why build a tool?</H2>
<P>Both the PSP and the TSP require the collection and analysis of metrics at a 
<I>very</I> fine-grained level. These metrics collection and analysis processes, 
however, are not trivial. In any real-world project, tool support for the PSP 
and TSP become important considerations. Although studies have demonstrated that 
people <U>can</U> maintain their productivity when using the PSP <I>without</I> 
tool support, the "frustration factor" inherent with such an approach tries the 
patience of all but the most disciplined engineers, making PSP behaviors 
difficult to sustain.</P>
<P>This initiative aims to develop an open-source tool to meet&nbsp;these 
needs.</P>
<P>Development on the dashboard is ongoing.&nbsp; To see the list of features
