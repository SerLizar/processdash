<h1>Managing Team Data (Team Leader)</h1>

<p>As a member of the team, the team leader may need to use his or her
<i>personal</i> Process Dashboard dataset to perform project tasks,
following the general instructions provided above for all team members.  In
contrast, the Team Dashboard requires minimal attention and requires no
data entry.  When running, it provides many useful features for project
planning and tracking.</p>

<h2><a name="pps"></a>Project Plan Summary</h2>

<p>The Team Project Plan Summary is a very useful tool for tracking team
progress.  You can open the team plan summary by opening the Team
Dashboard, selecting your team project, and choosing the "Rollup Plan
Summary" option from the list on the right. The Team Rollup Plan Summary
contains earned value reports for the project, quality reports and charts,
and reports of overall project metrics.</p>

<p>The Team Rollup Plan Summary can be very helpful in weekly team
meetings.  There are two easy ways to view the reports during that meeting.
First, you can <a href="Installing.html">install</a> the Team Dashboard on
a laptop computer, take that computer into the conference room for your
meeting, and open the various rollup reports.  Or, you can install the
Quick Launcher on a computer in the conference room, bring in a <a
href="SaveLaunchSnapshot.html">data backup</a> that you've saved from your
Team Dashboard, and open that data backup in the Quick Launcher.</p>

<p>Also, remember that the Project Plan Summary is editable.  If you
don't find a particular metric or chart on your report, put the report
into editing mode and add it.  If you don't find the metric you're
looking for in the list of provided items, please contact the Process
Dashboard development team.  We're always open to suggestions on how
to make the dashboard better!</p>


<h2><a name="ev"></a>Earned Value Reports</h2>

<p>The Team Rollup Plan Summary includes earned value reports for the
project. These reports roll up the individual earned value plans owned
by each team member into a single earned value plan for the entire
team.</p>

<p>Near the top of the team earned value report, you will find a
<i>Show Weekly View</i> hyperlink. Clicking this hyperlink will
display a chronological cross section of the project schedule that
summarizes the accomplishments of the previous week and lists the
tasks scheduled to be completed in the coming week. This is very
useful in the weekly team meeting.</p>

<p>Once the team has collected a minimum amount of earned value data,
these earned value reports will include forecasts for overall project
cost and completion date. You will notice that the team earned value
plan typically includes two different forecasts for the project
completion date.</p>

<ul>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'><b>Forecast Completion Date</b> is the
date the project is forecast to finish if no tasks are reassigned. If
the workload becomes unbalanced and tasks are not reassigned, then
some team members will finish earlier than others. Accordingly,
Forecast Completion Date is calculated by looking at each team
member's schedule and identifying the date the last person is
projected to finish. </li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'><b>Optimized Forecast Completion
Date</b> is the date the project is forecast to finish if tasks are
rebalanced optimally. If you were able to reassign work perfectly so
every team member finished at the same time, the project might
complete on the calculated date.</li>

</ul>

<p>Practically speaking, it is rarely possible to keep the workload
perfectly balanced, so a realistic forecast completion date would fall
between the two dates provided above. When the two forecast dates
differ significantly, the project workload is unbalanced and tasks
likely need to be reassigned.</p>

<p>At times, you may need to drill down into the earned value schedule
for a particular team member.  To do this, open Team Dashboard window
and select Task and Schedule from the File menu. Open the schedule for
the team project. If you highlight the sub-schedule for a particular
individual, you can choose "Filtered Chart" or "Filtered Report" from
the "View" menu to see graphical, statistical, and printable views of
that individual's earned value plan.</p>



<h2><a name="labelFiltering"></a>Analyzing Filtered Data Using Labels</h2>

<p>Although the project planning summary allows you to drill down into
subcomponents in your team plan, sometimes you will have a need to
analyze a subset of data that slices across those hierarchical
boundaries. To support this need, the dashboard has a powerful feature
for analyzing arbitrary subsets of team data based on keywords called
&quot;labels.&quot;</p>

<p>Labels can be associated with tasks using the Work Breakdown
Structure editor. During the team launch, you may not wish to spend
the entire team's time entering these labels. But after the launch is
complete, you might want to open the WBS and attach keywords to
various tasks. This is done by entering values in the &quot;Task
Labels&quot; column on the &quot;Task Details&quot; tab. Each task can
have any number of labels, separated by commas or spaces. Tasks will
inherit the labels of their WBS parent unless you request
otherwise.</p>

<p>After you edit labels and save the Work Breakdown Structure, you
can apply a label filter from any page of your Team Project Plan
Summary. To apply a label filter, click the filter icon that appears
at the top of the plan summary page (<img
src="../Images/icon-filter.png">). A form will be displayed, prompting
you for the label filter expression you wish to use. The syntax of
this expression is similar to familiar search engines like Google; the
form includes an explanation of the syntax.</p>

<p>When you apply the label filter, all the metrics you see in your
customized forms, charts, and reports will be filtered to include only
the tasks that match your filter expression. </p>

<h2><a name="backups"></a>Backing Up Project Data</h2>

<p>Over the course of the project, you should periodically save a backup of
the data in the Team Dashboard (saving a backup each week is recommended).
Just choose File&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Save Data Backup from the main Team
Dashboard window.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/team-save-data-backup.png"></p>

<p>If you retain these backups, you can open them later in the Quick
Launcher to see a historical view of the project's progress.</p>

<h2><a name="importExport"></a>Importing/Exporting Data</h2>

<p>During the project, the <i>individual dashboard datasets</i>
belonging to each team member export metrics data to the shared team
directory. This exported data is then imported into the <i>team
dashboard</i> to calculate rolled up team data.</p>

<p>This export/import mechanism is generally fully automatic. The
<i>individual dashboards</i> automatically export their data each
night, and each time they are shut down. The <i>team dashboard</i>
checks for new data every ten minutes, and imports any new data it
finds. As a result, you generally will not need to interact with the
export/import mechanism.</p>

<p>At times, however, you may wish to have a team member correct a
piece of erroneous data and quickly see the change reflected in the
team rollup. At these times, you can ask the individual to select
Export My Data Now from the script menu in their personal dashboard.
Once their export is complete, you can select Import All Data Now from
the list of tools on the right pane of the team dashboard.</p>

<p>In addition, if you are using task dependencies to coordinate work
between individuals, then you should open the team dashboard at least
once daily. This will allow the team dashboard to recompute the
completion status of dependent tasks, and communicate this data to
the individual dashboards.</p>


<h2><a name="reassigning"></a>Reassigning Tasks</h2>

<p>Workload balancing is an important part of team project
management. When you determine that you need to reassign tasks, take
these steps.</p>

<ol>

<li style='margin-top:6.0pt'>Select the team project in the team
dashboard, and choose Work Breakdown Structure Editor from the list
on the right.</li>

<li style='margin-top:6.0pt'>On the Team menu, turn on the Show Bottom
Up Time Panel option.  After individuals have begun collecting actual
data for the project, the colored balancing bars will update to
reflect planned time <i>remaining</i>.  You can use the colored bars
to balance the remaining work, and their end dates will roughly correspond to
the "Replan" dates in each team members earned value schedule.</li>

<li style='margin-top:6.0pt'>Switch to the Task Time tab of the Work
Breakdown Structure Editor. Edit values in the Assigned To column to
reassign the task(s) in question. Save the changes and close the Work
Breakdown Structure Editor.</li>

<li style='margin-top:6.0pt'>Any team member who was affected by the
change should take the following steps:

    <ol type=a>

    <li style='margin-top:4.0pt'>Follow the instructions in the <a
    href="CreateMemberPlans.html#syncWBS">Synchronize Work Breakdown
    Structure</a> help topic.  The synchronization logic will display
    a list of items added; review this list to ensure that the
    expected changes were made.</li>

    <li style='margin-top:4.0pt'>Open your earned value plan in the
    Task and Schedule dialog. For each newly assigned task, enter your
    best estimate of the task time remaining in the Planned Time (PT)
    column.</li>

    </ol></li>

</ol>

<h2><a name="dataProblems"></a>Bringing Problems to the Team's Attention</h2>

<p>While reviewing data, you may sometimes discover problems with the plan or
with actual data.  For example, an inspection might be done but one team
member forgot to mark it complete.  Or an individual might have marked a PSP
task complete without entering any actual size data.  You can annotate these
problems by switching to the Task Details tab and entering a value in the Data
Problems column.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/wbs-data-problem.png"></p>

<p>When a note is entered into the Data Problems column:</p>

<ul>

<li>The name of the WBS item (on the left side of the window) will be
highlighted in red.</li>

<li>If you hover the mouse over the name of the WBS item, the tooltip will
display the notes that were entered into the Data Problems column.</li>

<li>If this WBS item is assigned to one or more individuals, then when those
people open the WBS Editor from their personal dashboard, rows will
automatically be expanded to make the erroneous rows visible.</li>

</ul>

<p>The presence of a note in the Data Problems column will not have any effect
on team rollups or earned value calculations.  This column is strictly a
communications tool to facilitate the job of coaches, quality managers, team
leaders, etc.  When the problem has been resolved, you can clear the error
flag by deleting the note from the Data Problems column.</p>

<h2><a name="whatIf"></a>Exploring What-if scenarios</h2>

<p>During the launch, the team creates a comprehensive plan.  But change is
inevitable, and at times you may be asked to explore the impact of a major
plan change.  For example, stakeholders might want to know the schedule impact
of a significant change in scope.  Or management might need to know the
project impact that would result from gaining or losing team members.</p>

<p>To explore these "what-if" scenarios, choose "Save a Copy" from the "File"
menu of the WBS Editor.  You can explore changes in this copy without
corrupting the real team plan.</p>

<p>For more information on this feature, see the help topic on
<a href="AlternativePlans.html">exploring alternative plans</a>.


<h2><a name="quickLauncher"></a>Using the Quick Launcher</h2>

<p>When you install the Process Dashboard, it creates a shortcut that
opens your own personal dashboard dataset (and possibly a second
shortcut to open the team dashboard).  Sometimes, however, you need to
look at data from a different dashboard. For example, the quality
manager may need to look at data collected by a single individual, or
the team coach may need to view the team plan from a remote
location. The Quick Launcher makes this possible. If you select the
Tools for Team Leaders option during installation, a Process Dashboard
Quick Launcher shortcut will be created for your use.</p>

<p>Individuals can create data backup files by opening their personal
dashboard and choosing C&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Tools&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Save
Data Backup.  In the Team Dashboard, this option appears on the File menu.
You can drag-and-drop one of these data backup files onto the Quick
Launcher window, and a team or personal dashboard window will open,
displaying the data exactly as it appeared when the backup was made.</p>

<p>If you do not have a Quick Launcher shortcut, you can open a data backup
by choosing C&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Tools&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Open Dataset from a
personal dashboard, or by choosing File&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Open Dataset from
a Team Dashboard.  Then select the data backup file you would like to
open.</p>

<p>For more information on the creation and use of data backups, see
the <a href="../../help/Topics/AdvancedTopics/BackupData.html">data
backup</a> help topic.</p>
