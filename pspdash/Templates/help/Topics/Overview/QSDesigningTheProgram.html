<h2>Step 3: Designing the program</h2>

<P>The PSP provides Development scripts for all the levels.  To access the 
development script for this program, we can click the back button on the web 
browser to take us back to the main Process script which contains a link to 
the Development script, or we can just press the scripts button again.  When 
the scripts button is pressed, the dashboard always opens the web browser on 
a form that is appropriate for the current process phase.  In this case, it 
will open to the Development script.  We can also use the pull-down control 
on the scripts button.  Pressing the pull-down will bring up a menu of the 
phases of the project.  Picking a phase will open the appropriate script.  In 
this case, picking design will take us to the development script.</p>

<p>While designing program 5A, we will be sure to keep the dashboard's timer 
running.  This can be confirmed by noticing the state of the play/pause 
button.  For more information on the play/pause button, see the <a 
href="../Execution/PlayPause.html">play/pause button</a> help topic.</P>

<P>Once finished with the program design, we move on to the coding phase by 
clicking the completion button again.</p>
