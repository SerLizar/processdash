<h1>Managing Your Personal Earned Value Schedule (Team Member)</h1>

<p>When you joined the team project, the dashboard created an earned
value schedule for you to use in tracking your work. During the team
project launch, when you synchronized your work breakdown structure,
it created tasks and added them to your earned value schedule. In the
process, it copied over the initial estimates that you and your team
made during the planning process.</p>

<p>During the course of the project, however, you will gain new
insights into the tasks assigned to you, and it may become obvious
that some of the initial estimates were very inaccurate. When you
discover that a task's current time estimate is significantly high or
low, you should correct the estimate for that task. One easy way to
edit those time estimates is to open your earned value schedule.</p>

<p>In addition, when you add tasks or refine existing tasks, you will
need to enter the planned time values for the new tasks. The earned
value schedule is a convenient place to edit time estimates.</p>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>Open your earned value schedule by
clicking the C menu on the dashboard, and selecting Task and
Schedule. Open the schedule for this team project.

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>If there are problems with your earned
value schedule, a red Errors button will appear. Errors will also be
highlighted in the task list with red lettering.  You can get a short
description of the error by hovering the mouse over the red lettering,
and a longer description by clicking on the Errors button. </li>


<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>The top half of the window lists the
tasks assigned to you. Enter the planned time for various tasks in the
PT column. Values that are editable are displayed with a yellow
background.</li>


<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>You will generally not perform the tasks
in the order they appear in the hierarchy.  To define the order you
intend to perform the tasks, click the Flat View checkbox. This will
display your tasks in a plain list instead of a hierarchy.  You can
then reorder the tasks using the Move Task Up and Move Task Down
buttons. Defining the task order will allow the dashboard to generate
a meaningful report showing tasks that are due to be completed each
week.

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>The Dep column displays information
about task dependencies. If you discover a dependency that was
overlooked during team planning, you can double-click on this cell to
add it.</li>


<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>The bottom half of the window displays
the number of hours and minutes you plan to spend on project work for
various periods of time. As your project progresses, you may find that
you need to adjust these estimates as well. See the section above
titled &quot;Edit Planned Schedule Time&quot; on page 39 for
instructions. </li>


<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>It is always helpful to keep track of
your personal progress, and understand your personal contributions to
the team's goals. You can click the Chart button to see charts and
statistics comparing your actual progress to your planned
progress. For a printable version of this information, click the
Report button.  Your earned value schedule will appear in your web
browser, and will display charts and tables comparing your actual
progress to your plan. Earned value calculations will be used to
forecast your actual completion date; if this differs significantly
from your plan, you should bring this to the attention of your team
planning manager and/or your team leader.

<p>Near the top of this report, you will see a link that reads <i>Show
Weekly View</i>. This weekly view displays the tasks that you have
completed in the previous week, along with the tasks you had planned
to complete by the end of next week. This data is very useful for
planning purposes; most teams share and review this information in
their weekly team meeting.</p></li>
