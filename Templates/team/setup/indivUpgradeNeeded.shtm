<h2>Software Upgrade Needed</h2>

<p>New planning capabilities have been added to the Process Dashboard, and
your project team has chosen to use these new features.  Unfortunately, the
software on this computer is out-of-date.  To join this team project, you will
need to upgrade.</p>

<p>To resolve these problems, please contact your team leader and install an
upgraded version of the Process Dashboard.  Then try joining the project
again.</p>
