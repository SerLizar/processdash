<h1>Using the Dashboard During a Team Project Launch</h1>

<p>You will make extensive use of the Team Dashboard during the
project launch. Thus, if the Team Dashboard is not already running,
you should start it using the appropriately named shortcut on the team
leader's computer.</p>

<p>When you select the team project from the tree on the left, the pane on
the right will display a list of various tools and reports.  You will use
these tools extensively during the launch.</p>

<p>If you prefer, you can also open these tools from a web browser;
just choose Team Project Tools from the list described
above. The Team Project Tools page will open in your Web
browser.</p>
