<P><a name="NoConnection"></a><B>All my data elements say "NO CONNECTION".  What is wrong?</B></P>
<P>The scripting on the web pages that connects the web browser to the 
dashboard will return "NO CONNECTION" when the dashboard is not running.  The 
dashboard actually contains a very small HTTP server that provides all the 
web content and thus the content cannot be displayed when the dashboard is 
not running.</P>

<P><a name="ERROR"></a><B>Some of my data elements say "ERROR".  What is wrong?</B>
<P>Any time the dashboard runs into an error trying to calculate a particular 
data value, "ERROR" will show up in the web browser for that data element.  
Many times this is due to having a very small number of usable data points 
recorded by the dashboard.  For instance, if you start the dashboard for the 
first time and try to look at Process Summary forms for a PSP2.1 process, the 
"% To Date" fields will be filled with "ERROR".  This is because the total 
amount of time recorded in the tool is 0.  The percentage calculation 
attempts to divide by zero and returns the error.</P>

<P>Another problem can contribute to this condition as well.  If you are not 
in the habit of clicking the little "completion" button at the right end of 
the dashboard, some (or all) of your data will be ignored by the dashboard 
when creating reports and graphs.  The reporting features of the dashboard 
only report tasks that are marked as complete.  See the <a 
href="../Execution/CompletionButton.html">Using the Completion Button</a> 
help topic for more information.</P>

<P><a name="WhereIsConfig"></A><B>Where is the configuration file located?</B></P>
<P>The configuration file is named .pspdash on Unix systems and pspdash.ini 
on Windows systems.  It can be located in either of two places: the user's 
data directory or in the same directory as the pspdash.jar file.  The 
dashboard looks in the data directory first, then in the pspdash.jar 
installation directory.  See the <a 
href="../AdvancedTopics/ConfigurationFile.html">configuration file</A> help 
topic for more information about the configuration file and the settings that 
can be defined there.</P>

<P><a name="NoSubmit"></A><B>Why is there no "submit" button on the HTML forms?</B></P>
<P>The HTML forms used by the dashboard are continually "live".  There is no 
need to press a submit button to send your data to the dashboard.  Simply 
enter your data where necessary, and the dashboard will record it.</P>

<P><a name="TimerUpdate"></a><B>I've started the timer, but none of the numbers on my reports are changing.  How can I know that it is working?</b></P>
<P>Unlike the data input fields and various fields that can be calculated, 
the elements that report time on the reports do not update continually.  
However, they do get updated eventually.  The form will show changes to the 
time measurement approximately every five minutes.  Also, when a change is 
made from one process phase to another the timing numbers get updated.</P>

<P><a name="FormsColors"></a><b>What is the significance of the different text colors on the PSP process scripts and forms?</b></p>
<P>In his book <I>A Discipline for Software Engineering</I> where he outlines 
the Personal Software Process, Watts Humphrey introduces the various process 
elements for doing PSP work in a graduated manner.  Each PSP process is built 
upon the previous one.  As a way of showing which process elements were added 
to the previous process definition, the forms in the book highlight the new 
process elements.  These highlighted elements return to normal text at the 
next process level.</P>

<P>In our attempt to make our online forms as identical to the PSP forms as 
possible, we have included that detail.  However, there are many places where 
the Process Dashboard makes certain steps on the scripts and forms 
unnecessary (e.g. instructions to sum up various data items -- the dashboard 
sums them for you).  Also there are places where the dashboard slightly 
changes the way certain steps are performed (e.g. instead of performing a 
PROBE calculation, the PROBE tool should be used).  In these cases, the color 
in the forms changes to indicate this slight departure from the "true PSP 
forms".</P>

<P><a name="DCRSCR"></a><b>What happened to the DCR and SCR processes?</b></p>
<P>The DCR and SCR processes which were shipped with prior versions of the 
Process Dashboard are still available, but are now distributed as add-on 
process sets.  They can be downloaded from the Process Dashboard website at 
<em>http://processdash.sourceforge.net.</em>  For instructions on 
installation of add-on process sets, see the <a 
href="../Overview/HowToInstall.html">installation</a> help topic.</p>

<P><a name="Website"></a><b>Where can I get the latest information about the Process Dashboard?</b></p>
<P>The latest developments in the development of the Process Dashboard, 
including the latest version can be found at 
<em>http://processdash.sourceforge.net.</em></p>

<P><a name="BugReport"></a><B>I think I've found a bug.  Whom do I contact?</b></p>
<P>You can fill out a bug form on our web site at 
<em>http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=9858</em> or if you would rather 
send us an email, write to <em>processdash-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</em></p>
