<h1>Plan Project Support Tasks</h1>

<b>(TSP Launch Meeting No. 3)</b>

<p>In a TSP project launch, teams typically finish meeting No. 3 by
developing a project support plan. This plan lists support tools and
facilities that are needed but missing. As you create that plan, add
tasks to your project WBS to obtain or develop each missing support
item.</p>
