<h1>Save Backup of Project Data</h1>

<p>At the conclusion of your team project launch, you should save a
data backup of the team dashboard. From the main dashboard window,
choose C&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Tools&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Save Data
Backup.</p>

<p>This will save a ZIP file with a snapshot of the data for your team
project. You can use the Process Dashboard Quick Launcher to open this
backup at any time in the future, and view all reports exactly as they
appeared when the backup was made.</p>

<p>It is also a good idea to save a data backup each week during your
project. This provides a useful history of your project's
progress.</p>

<h2>Submitting Data to the SEI</h2>

<p>At the end of their launch, licensed users of the Team Software
Process are required to submit their data to the Software Engineering
Institute.  The SEI uses this data to perform research into the
benefits of the TSP.</p>

<p>To comply with this requirements, teams are encouraged to use the "Save
Data Backup" feature, then send the resulting ZIP file to the SEI.  If your
company is concerned about releasing proprietary information in this
backup, you might consider saving the backup in "Redacted" format and
choosing to scramble the types of data (e.g. task names, names of
individuals, etc) that you deem to be sensitive.</p>

<p>If you have created your own <a href="MetricsCollectionFramework.html">custom
metrics collection framework</a>, you will need to include a copy of that
framework (which is also a ZIP file) along with your data submission.</p>


<h2>Creating HTML Snapshots</h2>

<p>At times, you may need to share a copy of your plan with a manager
or other stakeholder who does not have the Dashboard Quick Launcher
installed. For this purpose, a second export mechanism is provided
that saves a non-interactive copy of the team project plan summary
form. To accomplish this, open the team dashboard, navigate to the
team project, and select Save Snapshot of Project Plan from the script
menu. You can choose to save the file in various formats, which can be
viewed later in programs such as Internet Explorer.</p>
