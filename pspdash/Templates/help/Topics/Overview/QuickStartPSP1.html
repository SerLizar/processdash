<H1>Quick start example: a PSP1 project</H1>
<P>This example will show how to use the Process Dashboard for a simple PSP1 
level software project.</P>

<P>The first thing we need to do to get started is to create a new PSP1 project in the dashboard.  To do that, we will start the hierarchy editor by choosing Hierarchy from the Configure menu.</P>

<!-- screen shot of the initial hierarhcy editor -->

<P>We need to decide where to place this project in our work breakdown 
structure.  At this point, the dashboard only has two nodes in the project 
hierarchy tree: "Project" and "Non Project".  We will place our PSP1 project 
under the Project node shown.  To do that we will select the Project node by 
clicking it once.  Next we will pick on the edit menu choose "Add Template" 
followed by "PSP1".  This will add a PSP1-based project to the project 
hierarchy as a child of Project.  When the new project is added, it is given 
a default name.  We can change the name to better describe what we are 
working on.  In this case, we will name the project "3B", since we will be 
working on the 3B program from the <I>A Displine for Software Engineering</I> 
book in this example.  For more information on using the hierarchy editor, 
see the <a href="../Planning/UsingHierarchyEditor.html">Using the hierarchy 
editor"</a> help topic.</P>
