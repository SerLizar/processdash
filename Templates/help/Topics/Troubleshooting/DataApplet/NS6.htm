<H1>Problem with browser</H1>

<P>We're sorry, but Netscape 6 and higher is not currently capable of
supporting the dashboard's data integration features.

<P>The dashboard <b>can</b> integrate with the following browsers:

<ul>

<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.htm">Internet
    Explorer</a> 4.0 or greater <i>(on Windows systems only)</i>

<li><a href="http://home.netscape.com/download/archive.html">Netscape 4.7</a>

</ul>

<p>Don't worry - you can still keep using Netscape 6 or higher as your
system-default web browser, and use a different web browser with the
dashboard:<ul>

<li>Netscape will allow you to have several versions of Communicator
installed on your computer without conflict. So you can install Netscape
4.7 on your computer for use with the dashboard, and keep using Netscape
6.0 or higher as your system-default web browser.

<li>(Windows systems only) Or, you can avoid installing multiple versions
of Netscape by using Internet Explorer with the dashboard while keeping
Netscape as your system default. (Unless you really dislike IE, this may be
the simplest option. And for what it's worth, IE <u>does</u> work better
with the dashboard than Netscape.)
</ul>

<p>To correct this problem, print this page and follow the instructions
below:</p>

<ol>

<li>Choose between the options listed above, and make certain you have an
appropriate browser installed on your system.

<li>Shut down the dashboard if it is running.

<li>Open your configuration file (which is located at 
<code><!--#include file="/control/showenv.class?config" --></code>)
and add one of the following lines to that file:

<pre>     browser.command=<font color="#FF0000">C:/Program Files/Internet Explorer/IExplore.exe</font></pre>

if you want the dashboard to display scripts and forms in Internet Explorer (recommended), or

<pre>     browser.command=<font color="#FF0000">C:/Program Files/Netscape/Communicator/Program/Netscape.exe</font></pre>

to use Netscape. <b>NOTE: make certain to edit the browser path</b> (the
part in red above) so it correctly points to the executable for the browser
you wish to use. To separate directory names, use either a forward slash
(&quot;<code><font color="#FF0000">/</font></code>&quot;) or a double
backslash (&quot;<code><font color="#FF0000">\\</font></code>&quot;).

<li>Restart the dashboard, and open any script or form.  The script/form
should appear in your newly designated browser.<br><br><b>Troubleshooting:</b>
<ul>

<li>If the form opens in the same browser as before, then you either failed
to correctly locate your configuration file, or you mistyped the
&quot;<code>browser.command=</code>&quot; portion of the configuration
line.  Go back to step 2, but be more careful in step 3 to correctly open
and edit the file.

<li>If you receive an error dialog, then you most likely made an error in
the line you added to the configuration file.  Open your configuration file
(<code><!--#include file="/control/showenv.class?config" --></code>)
and doublecheck that you specified the correct path and filename to your
web browser. Remember that you must separate directory names either with
forward slashes (&quot;<code><font color="#FF0000">/</font></code>&quot;)
or double backslashes (&quot;<code><font
 color="#FF0000">\\</font></code>&quot;).

</ul>
