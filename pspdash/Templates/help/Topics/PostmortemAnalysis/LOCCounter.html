<H1>Counting LOC</H1>

<p>Measuring size is an important step in the PSP Postmortem phase. If you 
don't pause in your project postmortem to measure the number of added, 
deleted, and modified LOC, you may forever lose the opportunity to capture 
these metrics. It only takes a few moments, and provides you with valuable 
data for future planning efforts.</p> 

<P>You may already have a LOC counter that you use on a regular basis. (In 
fact, most people who complete the PSP training course write a LOC counter 
during the training.) If you do need a LOC counter, one is built into the 
dashboard. A link to this LOC counter is included in the Postmortem scripts 
for PSP0.1 and up.</P>

<P>The built-in LOC counter helps to determine the number of physical LOC 
that you have added, deleted, and modified. It also displays a "redlined" 
version of the program file, which can be <I>very</I> useful for peer 
reviews.</P>

<P>If you want to measure the size of a newly created file, just leave the 
"Initial File" section blank, and put the newly created file in the "Modified 
File" section.</P>

<P>The LOC counter that is built into the Process Dashboard is extendable to 
allow user defined LOC counting rules.  Methods for writing your own LOC 
counting code that can work with the Process Dashboard will be detailed in 
the <I>Process Authoring Manual</I> when it becomes available on our 
website.</P>
