<h1>Create Quality Plan</h1>
<b>(TSP Launch Meeting No. 5)</b>

<p>Because of the way the dashboard currently handles team quality
data, it is necessary to <a href="CreateMemberPlans.html">create
individual team member plans</a> before you can view the team quality
plan.  This means that you should most likely alter the launch
schedule, folding launch meeting No. 6 back into launch meeting
No.4.</p>

<p>Once you have successfully <a
href="ViewBottomUpPlan.html">validated the bottom-up team plan</a>,
you may proceed with the steps below.</p>

<p>Team quality metrics are calculated using team project quality
parameters. These parameters can be edited on the Team Project
Parameters and Settings page, which can be opened by clicking the
appropriate item on the main Team Dashboard window.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/team-settings-page.png"></p>

<p>This page includes:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>A Quality Profile Parameters section for setting PQI
    parameters.</li>

    <li>An Estimated Phase Yields section for entering the yields your
    team plans to achieve in each quality phase.</li>

    <li>An Estimated Defect Injection Rates section for entering
    estimated project defect injection rates.</li>

    </ul>

<p>Follow the guidance provided in the TSP process to create these
estimates.</p>


<p>Using the quality parameters entered on the page above, and data
from your team's project plan, the dashboard will calculate a quality
plan for your project and include it as part of the overall project
plan. To view this quality plan, switch to the Team Dashboard window,
select the team project from the tree on the left, and click the
Rollup Plan Summary option in the list on the right.  The rollup plan
summary will appear in your web browser.</p>

<p>The process mentor for your organization may have populated your
project summary with charts, forms, and reports that you can use to
view the planned quality metrics. (See the <a
href="FormsReports.html">Creating / Customizing Process Forms and
Reports</a> help topic for more information.)</p>

<p>You can drill down and see the quality plans for various project
subcomponents by clicking on the (<img
src="../Images/icon-hier-nav.png">) icon.</p>


<p>If the calculated quality metrics do not meet your team's quality
goals, you may edit the project quality parameters described above, in
keeping with the guidance in the TSP process.  To simplify this task,
open two browser windows: one containing the project parameters page,
and the other containing the calculated quality plan.  As you edit the
quality parameters, calculated values (displayed as numbers in grey
boxes) will recalculate automatically.  To update views of graphical
charts, you will need to refresh the page manually.</p>
