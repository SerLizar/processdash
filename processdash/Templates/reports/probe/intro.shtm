Size and time estimating are complex skills, best developed through
experience.  As you strive to improve your estimating skills, your
primary goal should be estimating accuracy.

<p>The Proxy Based Estimating process (PROBE) includes statistical
methods that can help you to improve your estimating accuracy over
time. These methods analyze your past estimating performance, and
attempt to mathematically remove any consistent estimating bias found.

<p>This wizard will help you to perform this portion of the PROBE
process.  Keep in mind that:<ul>

  <li>PROBE is not magic - you must actively exercise your engineering
      judgement to ensure that you produce sensible estimates.

  <li>The PROBE methods implicitly assume that the project you are
      currently estimating is similar to the projects you have completed
      in the past.  If this is not true, use PROBE-generated estimates
      with caution.

  <li>PROBE works best when you are consistent in your use of the Size
      Estimating Template.
