Errors.Cannot_Open.Title=Could not Open Project Files
Errors.Cannot_Open.Server_FMT=\
    The Work Breakdown Structure Editor attempted to read\n\
    project data from the following location:\n\
    \        {0}\n\
    Unfortunately, this server could not be contacted.  Make\n\
    certain you are connected to the network and try again.
Errors.Cannot_Open.Dir_FMT=\
    The Work Breakdown Structure Editor attempted to open\n\
    project data located in:\n\
    \        {0}\n\
    Unfortunately, this file/directory could not be found.\n\
    You may need to map a network drive to edit this data.
Errors.Cannot_Open.Zip_FMT=\
    The Work Breakdown Structure Editor attempted to open\n\
    project data located in the file:\n\
    \        {0}\n\
    Unfortunately, this file does not appear to contain any\n\
    WBS data.

Errors.Cannot_Save.Title=Unable to Save
Errors.Cannot_Save.Server_FMT=\
    The Work Breakdown Structure Editor encountered an unexpected\n\
    error and was unable to save data.  Please doublecheck your\n\
    network connection.  Then, try saving again.
Errors.Cannot_Save.Dir_FMT=\
    The Work Breakdown Structure Editor encountered an unexpected error\n\
    and was unable to save data. This problem might have been caused by\n\
    poor network connectivity, or by read-only file permissions. Please\n\
    check to ensure that you can write to the following location:\n\
    \        {0}
Errors.Cannot_Save.Zip_FMT=${Errors.Cannot_Save.Dir_FMT}
Errors.Cannot_Save.Save_Advice=\
    If you shut down the Work Breakdown Structure Editor without\n\
    resolving this problem, any changes you have made will be lost.\n\
    To avoid losing your changes, you may wish to choose "Save a Copy"\n\
    from the "File" menu.

Errors.Lost_Lock.Title=Network Connectivity Problems
Errors.Lost_Lock.Message=\
    Although you opened the work breakdown structure in read-write\n\
    mode, your connection to the network was broken, and your lock\n\
    on the WBS was lost.  In the meantime, another individual has\n\
    opened the work breakdown structure for editing, so your lock\n\
    could not be reclaimed.\n\
    \ \n\
    As a result, you will no longer be able to save changes to the\n\
    work breakdown structure.  You are strongly encouraged to close\n\
    and reopen the work breakdown structure editor.
Errors.Lost_Lock.Save_Advice=\
    To avoid losing your changes, you may wish to choose "Save a Copy"\n\
    from the "File" menu.

Errors.Open_Read_Only.Title=Open Project in Read-Only Mode
Errors.Open_Read_Only.Prompt=\
    Would you like to open the project anyway, in read-only mode?

Errors.Concurrent_Use.Message_FMT=\
    The Work Breakdown Structure for this project is currently\n\
    locked for editing by {0}.
Errors.Concurrent_Use.Anonymous_User=someone on another machine

Errors.Read_Only_Files.Message_FMT=\
    The Work Breakdown Structure Editor stores data for this project\n\
    into XML files located at:\n\
    \        {0}\n\
    \ \n\
    Unfortunately, the current filesystem permissions do not allow\n\
    you to modify those files.

Errors.Cannot_Create_Lock.Message_FMT=\
    The Work Breakdown Structure Editor stores data for this project\n\
    into XML files located at:\n\
    \        {0}\n\
    \ \n\
    The WBS Editor attempted to lock those files for writing, but the\n\
    operating system was unable to secure a write lock.  This is an\n\
    unusual situation, possibly caused by the current configuration of\n\
    the remote network directory.

Recommend_Read_Only.Title=Open Read-Only?
Recommend_Read_Only.Option_Read_Write=Open in read-write mode
Recommend_Read_Only.Option_Read_Only=Open in read-only mode
Recommend_Read_Only.Simultaneous_Prompt=\
    Would you like to open the WBS in read-only mode?\n\
    This is recommended if you only want to view the\n\
    data, and do not intend to make any changes.
Recommend_Read_Only.Exclusive_Prompt=\
    The Work Breakdown Structure is shared by the\n\
    entire team. If you only intend to view data\n\
    (not modify anything), you should open the WBS\n\
    in read-only mode, so others can make changes.\n\
    Which would you like to do?

File_Replace.Confirm.Title=Confirm Data Replacement Operation
File_Replace.Confirm.Message=\
    You have requested to replace the planned data in this Work Breakdown\n\
    Structure with data from a WBS ZIP file.  This is a potentially\n\
    destructive operation, so it must be performed with care.\n\
    \ \n\
    A "replace data" operation is appropriate in some scenarios:\n\
    \ \n\
    \ \u2022 If network connectivity problems prevented you from saving\n\
    \    changes in the past; you saved your changes into a WBS data\n\
    \    zip file; you now wish to load those edits back into the team\n\
    \    plan; and no one else has edited the team plan in the meantime\n\
    \ \n\
    \ \u2022 If your team has created several alternative plans during\n\
    \    a team project launch, and you wish to make one of those\n\
    \    alternatives the official plan before the project begins\n\
    \ \n\
    \ \u2022 If you saved a WBS data file to work with it offline, you\n\
    \    wish to apply your offline changes, and no one else has altered\n\
    \    the real project WBS in the meantime\n\
    \ \n\
    When you perform a "replace data" operation, all of the data in the\n\
    current plan will be discarded and replaced with the data from the\n\
    file you specify.  Please ensure that this is your intent.\n\
    \ \n\
    Would you like to proceed, and replace the data in this WBS with data\n\
    from a WBS data ZIP file?

    edits to this work breakdown structure:

    An unexpected error occurred while the WBS Editor was replacing\n\
    the data in this project plan. Some changes may have been partially\n\
    applied, so to avoid editing problems, please try the "Replace Data"\n\
    operation again. If the problem persists, please send the following\n\
    error information to the Process Dashboard development team,\n\
