<h1>Team Project Relaunch Wizard</h1>

<h2>Unable to Copy Files</h2>

<form action='wizard.class' method='post'>
<input type='hidden' name='page' value='teamConfirm'>

<p>The relaunch wizard needs to copy project data from the old project plan
to the new project plan.  Unfortunately, it was unable to perform this
task.</p>

<ul>

<li>Please ensure that you are connected to the network.</li>

<li>If you are currently editing the Work Breakdown Structure for the
&quot;<!--#echo [setup//Relaunch_Source_Path] -->&quot; project, you must
close the Work Breakdown Structure Editor before proceeding.</li>

</ul>

<p>After you have corrected these problems, click &quot;Next&quot; to try
the operation again.  If the problem persists,
<a href="/control/showConsole.class">click here</a> for additional
information about the error that was encountered.</p>
