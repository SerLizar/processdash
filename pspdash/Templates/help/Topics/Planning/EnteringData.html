<H1>Entering process data</H1>
<P>There are two main ways of entering data into the Process Dashboard.  The 
first is through various input tools and dialogs provided by the dashboard 
(e.g. the <a href="UsingProbeTool.html">PROBE tool</a>, the <a 
href="../Execution/EnteringDefects.html">defect dialog</a>, etc.).</p>

<p>The second is through the various PSP forms.  The forms are provided 
through a web interface.  See the <a 
href="../Execution/AccessingScripts.html">Accessing Process Scripts</a> help 
topic for more info on how to access the scripts.</p>

<h2>The nature of the script files</h2>
<P>The script files themselves are implemented via static and sometimes 
dynamic HTML pages.  The dashboard software actually contains a very small 
HTTP server embedded within it.  This server allows communication between the 
HTML pages and the process data that is tracked by the dashboard.</P>

<P>The HTML pages are "live" at all times.  To process data, you merely need 
to click on the appropriate data entry elements and type in the data.  Once 
you pick anywhere else on the page (to signal that you are finished entering 
information), the dashboard will automatically pick up your data -- no need 
to press any kind of "submit data" button.</P>

<P>Many times there will be greyed-out data boxes.  These are data elements 
that are computed automatically by the dashboard.  They are not directly 
editable, but rather they will update when other data elements that they are 
related to get updated.</p>

<P>To find out more information about the different process scripts that are 
available, see the <a href="../Overview/ProcessScripts.html">process scripts</a> help 
topic.</P>
