<h2>Step 2: Planning the project</h2>

<P>Now that the project exists, we can start the planning of our work.  The 
PSP provides scripts for planning, development, postmortem work, etc., so 
let's go look at the planning script for our new PSP1 project.  This is done 
by selecting our newly created project via the hierarchy menus (the dashboard 
will automatically select the planning phase -- the first development phase 
of a PSP1 project), then clicking the scripts button.  We should also click 
the play button on the dashboard to start timing our planning activities.</p>

<!-- screen shot of menus selected down to planning with callouts on scripts 
     button and play button -->

<P>The dashboard responds by bringing up the PSP1 planning script.  Reading 
through the script, we see that once we understand the requirements for 
program 3B, we need to do a size estimate.  To guide our estimation, we can 
use the PROBE method.  Following the <U>PROBE method</u> link on the planning 
script brings up the PROBE Estimating Script.  Reading through this script we 
see that once we have produced a conceptual design, we need to fill out the 
Size Estimating Template.  The dashboard provides both the template itself an 
the instruction script for its use.  Following the link for the <U>Size 
Estimating Template</u> brings up a dynamic HTML version of the template.  
For ready reference, the template has a link near the top to display the Size 
Estimating Template instructions form.  If you click on this link, a second 
browser will be started so that you can have the instructions and the 
template side by side on your screen.</p>

     summary form, finish by clicking finished button and moving on -->
