<p>The Process Dashboard Enterprise Server provides a secure repository for
team and personal metrics data, and it allows you to view that data by
clicking hyperlinks in your web browser. When you click a dataset link on this
site, the data will open in the Process Dashboard or Team Dashboard
application, as appropriate.</p>

<p>If you have used the Process Dashboard in the past, it's likely that your
computer already contains the software you need to open dashboard
datasets.</p>

website and your computer is unable to open the file, please follow the
instructions below.</p>
