<h1>Cumulative Earned Value</h1>

<p>This chart displays your planned and actual progress at a glance.</p>

<p>The horizontal axis depicts the passage of time, and the vertical axis
displays percent complete.  The lines on the chart convey various measures
of progress:</p>

<ul>

<li>The red <b>"Plan"</b> line shows your planned progress, beginning at 0%
and reaching 100% on the date when you could finish the work if everything
were to go according to plan.</li>

<li>The blue <b>"Actual"</b> line shows your actual progress so far.  In
the PSP earned value technique, you do not receive credit for partially
completed tasks; you only receive credit for tasks that have been marked
complete.  So each time you mark a task complete, the blue line will rise
to indicate that you are closer to your goal of completing the project.
When you finish all of the work in this task list, the blue line will reach
100%.</li>

<li>If your actual progress is ahead or behind the original plan, the dashboard
may be able to <a href="TaskScheduleDates.html#replanDate">calculate</a> an
adjusted date when the work is most likely to finish, taking the current
schedule slip into account but assuming that remaining work will fall in line
with the original plan.  This will be displayed on the chart as a pink
<b>"Replan"</b> line.</li>

<li>Once you begin collecting data, the dashboard may be able to
<a href="TaskScheduleDates.html#forecastDate">calculate</a> an adjusted date
when the work is most likely to finish, assuming that you make progress in the
future at a rate similar to the past.  This will be displayed on the chart as
a green <b>"Forecast"</b> line.  Sometimes, the dashboard is also able to 
<a href="TaskScheduleRanges.html">calculate a range</a> of dates that place an
upper and lower bound on the completion date forecast with a 70% error margin.
If so, a green cone will depict this range of dates.</li>

<li>When you roll up data for a team, the dashboard will also 
<a href="TaskScheduleDates.html#optForecastDate">calculate</a> an
<b>"Optimized"</b> completion date.  This is the date that the project would
be forecast to complete, if the workload were rebalanced perfectly so everyone
finishes at the same time.</li>

<li>If you have saved a baseline for this schedule, a brown
<b>"Baseline"</b> line will appear.  This shows what the "Plan" line
looked like at the moment you saved the baseline.</li>

</ul>

<h3 NO_NUMBER="t">Interpretation</h3>

<p>The simplest and most useful way to use this chart, is to compare the
Actual line to the Plan.  If the Actual line is above the plan line, you
are ahead of schedule.  If it is below the plan line, you are behind
schedule.</p>

<p>When you are behind schedule, it could be due to the fact that you are
unable to spend as many direct hours as you planned.  If so, the
<a href="EV-cumDirectTimeChart.html">Cumulative Direct Time</a> chart will
make this problem clear.  Otherwise, you could be behind because tasks are
taking longer than expected.  The <a href="EV-cumCombinedChart.html">Earned
Value vs. Cost</a> chart will highlight that problem.</p>

<p>Next, the Replan and Forecast lines can be helpful tools for strategic
planning.  But be wary about using the Forecast line during the first few
weeks of your schedule.  When limited actual data is available, the forecast
date may be unstable, changing dramatically each time a task is marked
complete.  During those initial weeks, it is better to watch the Replan line.
Once you have collected a few weeks' worth of data, the Forecast line will
be much more useful.  If the forecast line is consistently predicting a
date that will not allow you to meet your commitments, you may need to
escalate the issue.</p>

<p>On a team rollup, lines will be drawn for the "Forecast" and the
"Optimized Forecast."  The optimized line shows the date work might
complete if the workload is rebalanced perfectly.  In contrast, the
Forecast line will be displaying the date when the last person is projected
to finish, assuming that no tasks are reassigned.  When the Optimized line
and the Forecast line are far apart, this is an indication that the team
workload is unbalanced, and tasks may need to be reassigned.</li>

<p>A forecast line cannot be drawn until you have logged some time against
the schedule and marked at least one task complete.  When you are looking
at a team rollup, the forecast is computed by finding the date when the
last team member will finish.  If the schedule for any team member does not
have a forecast, then no forecast can be computed for the team either.  So
if your team rollup doesn't have a forecast line, check to see whether some
of your team members are still 0% complete.  The easiest way to do this is
to open the Task &amp; Schedule window for the team schedule.</p>

<p>Normally, the Plan line will extend to reach 100%.  However, if you
have set an &quot;<a href="TaskScheduleSteps.html#shortSchedule">end
date</a>&quot; for your schedule, and there is not enough time in your
plan to finish all of the work, the Plan line will not reach 100%.  In
this case, the dashboard's forecast calculation may also decide that
the work will never complete, and no forecast line will be drawn on
the chart.  In these cases, you may need to escalate the issue.</li>

<p>When a Baseline is present, the Baseline line usually will <b>not</b>
end at the 100% mark.  For example, if the planned cost of your project has
grown since the baseline was saved, the planned line will reach higher than
the baseline.  Thus, you can compare the Baseline to the Plan to visualize
Baseline Growth.</p>
