<H1>The Task &amp; Schedule Tool</H1>

<P>The task and schedule tool allows you to generate a schedule for
completing tasks, and track progress against that schedule using earned
value. You can open the task and schedule tool by selecting the &quot;Task
&amp; Schedule&quot; option on the <a href="../Execution/ConfigureMenu.html">configure
menu</a>.</P>

<P>If you haven't created any schedules, the dashboard will immediately
jump to the &quot;Create New Schedule&quot; prompt. If you have already created at least one schedule, a task &amp; schedule
chooser window will appear.</P>
<P ALIGN="center"><IMG BORDER="0"
SRC="../../Images/TaskScheduleChooser.png" width="363" height="230"></P>
<P>This window displays all the schedules you have created. After you click
on a schedule to highlight it, you can use the buttons along the bottom to
open it, rename it, or delete it. The &quot;Cancel&quot; button will close
this window.</P>
<P>Clicking the &quot;New...&quot; button will create a new schedule. The
dashboard will ask you to enter a name for the new schedule. Enter a name
and press OK. An empty task &amp; schedule window will appear, and will
immediately prompt you for the first task you want to add to the schedule. </P>
<P>The task &amp; schedule window combines the PSP task planning template
(table C47) and the schedule planning template (table C49) into one window.
&nbsp;The top portion of the window contains the list of tasks that are
included in this schedule, and the bottom portion of the window displays
the time periods included in the schedule. </P>
<P ALIGN="center"><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="../../Images/TaskSchedule.png"
WIDTH="386" HEIGHT="368"> </P>
<P ALIGN="left">Editable values appear with a yellow background. If you are
unfamiliar with the various columns in the task and schedule planning
templates, you can hover the pointer over the column headings and a tool
tip will tell you what the abbreviated heading stands for. </P>
<H2>Step 1: Add tasks to the task list&nbsp; </H2>
<P>To create a schedule, you decide what tasks you want included in the
schedule, and add them with the &quot;Add Task...&quot; button. You can
add&nbsp;any node in your hierarchy to the task list; it will be added,
along with all its children, recursively. As an improvement over the
traditional task planning template, the dashboard displays your task list
in a hierarchical fashion. You can expand and contract this hierarchical
view to get coarser- or finer-grained data. </P>
<P>It is also worth pointing out that if you edit your hierarchy in the
future (using the <A HREF="UsingHierarchyEditor.html">hierarchy editor</A>),
your changes will automatically propagate into affected task lists. For
example, if you add a node named &quot;Release 3.0&quot; to a task list,
then in the future if you were to create/delete subtasks underneath
&quot;Release 3.0&quot;, they would automatically appear in the task list /
disappear from the task list.) </P>
<P>Once you have added tasks to the task list, you can use the &quot;Delete
Task...&quot; button to remove them, and the &quot;Move Task Up/Down&quot;
buttons to alter their relative order. Note that these options are only
available for the <U>top-level</U> tasks. (Top-level tasks are the tasks
that you explicitly added using the &quot;Add Task...&quot; button; in the
task list, they appear as immediate children of the root of the tree.) At
this time it is not possible to delete sub-tasks from your task list or
change their relative order. If you want to do either of these things, you
have two choices: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>Make the changes in the hierarchy editor (for example, moving nodes
    up or down to change the relative ordering of tasks)</LI>
  <LI>Manually add all the subtasks to the task list as top-level tasks
    instead of adding their parent to the task list.</LI>
</UL>
<P>You should generally try to put the tasks in chronological order (the
first task in the list should be the one you plan to work on first, and so
on). Once you have added tasks to your task list, it wouldn't hurt to click
the &quot;Save&quot; button.&nbsp;</P>
<H2>Step 2: Estimate task time </H2>
<P>Once tasks are added to the task list, the dashboard will look up
information like the planned time, actual time, etc. from the appropriate
project plan summary forms, and display it in the appropriate boxes. You
can click on any value with a yellow background and edit it, and the change
will appear immediately on the associated project plan summary form.
(Similarly, if you edit one of these values on a project plan summary form,
the new value will automatically appear here in the task list.)</P>

<P>If
some tasks still have a planned time (the column heading is &quot;PT&quot;)
of 0:00, you can enter your time estimates for those tasks
now.</P>

<H2>Step 3: Estimate calendar time</H2>

<P>To generate a schedule, the dashboard needs to know how much time you
plan to spend working on these tasks, and when you plan to spend it. This
information is displayed in the bottom portion of the window. Each row in
the table represents a time period. These time periods are consecutive;
each time period begins when the previous time period ends.</P>

<P>Think about how much time you have available to work on the tasks listed
in your task list. Describe a time period by entering the dates it will
start and stop, and in the &quot;PT&quot; (Planned Time) column enter the
number of hours you think you can spend during that time period.</P>

<P>Most of the time people have fairly predictable schedules - for example,
you might say &quot;I'm going to spend 20 hours a week on this until it
gets done.&quot; Since this is the most common situation, the schedule
will, by
default, grow automatically to meet the demand. You don't have to
manually add rows to your schedule until there are enough hours to cover
the tasks - instead, the schedule template will automatically duplicate the
final row in the table until there are enough hours. You can easily see
where the automatic portion of the schedule starts because the automatic
rows are displayed with a medium gray font. Thus, the black rows in the
schedule template are rows that you have manually created/edited, and the
gray rows are the ones which have been automatically added to meet the time
requirements. <I>(<B><A NAME="shortSchedule">Note</A></B>: you can disable this automatic schedule expansion
simply by making the final manual row in your schedule contain zero planned hours.
The dashboard recognizes that infinite duplications of the &quot;zero&quot; row
will not help you get any more hours, so it leaves the schedule short and
assigns some of your tasks the planned completion date of
&quot;never&quot;.)</I>&nbsp;</P>

<P> As in the task list, editable cells have a yellow background.
Since time periods are contiguous, editing the &quot;To&quot; value on one row will cause the &quot;From&quot; value on
the following row to change accordingly.
Similarly, editing the &quot;From&quot; value on one row will cause the
&quot;To&quot; value on the previous row to change. If you make changes to the last
black row (which is used as a template and copied to make
all the subsequent gray rows), all of the gray rows will be regenerated
accordingly. If you edit a value in one of the gray rows, it (and all of
the rows before it) will become &quot;real&quot;, and the row in question
will become the new &quot;template row&quot; upon which subsequent gray
rows will be based.</P>

<P>If you need to extend the schedule past its optimal completion date,
click the &quot;Add Row&quot; button to create a new row at the bottom of
your schedule. The &quot;Insert Row&quot; button will split the currently
selected time period into two separate rows, while the &quot;Delete
Row&quot; will merge the currently selected time period with the one that
follows it. (Note that it isn't possible to delete an automatically
generated row. If you're trying to force your schedule to end early, you
should do so by entering 0 planned hours for the final time period, as
described <A HREF="#shortSchedule">above</A>.)</P>

<H2>Step 4: Track your progress&nbsp;</H2>

<P>With the list of tasks and the calendar of available time in place, the
dashboard will calculate planned completion dates for each task. As you
work, you should:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Accurately log time against tasks using the <A
    HREF="../Execution/PlayPause.html">play/pause button</A> and the <A
    HREF="../Execution/UsingTimeLogEditor.html">time log editor</A>. Time
    logged against tasks in your task list will appear in the &quot;Actual
    Time&quot; columns of the task list and schedule list.</LI>
  <LI>Mark tasks complete using the <A
    HREF="../Execution/CompletionButton.html">completion checkbox</A>. When
    tasks are marked complete, the completion date will appear in the task
    list, and you will &quot;earn&quot; the planned value for that task.</LI>
</UL>
<P>While your project is in progress, you can click on the
&quot;Chart&quot; button for access to earned value charts and numerical
analyses:</P>
<P ALIGN="center">&nbsp;<IMG BORDER="0"
SRC="../../Images/TaskChartValue.png" WIDTH="322" HEIGHT="265"></P>
<P ALIGN="center"><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="../../Images/TaskChartStats.png"
WIDTH="325" HEIGHT="265"></P>
<P ALIGN="left">If you prefer, you can view this information in HTML, and
even export it Excel, by clicking the &quot;Report&quot; button.</P>
<H2 ALIGN="left">The Save Button</H2>
<P ALIGN="left">If you edit the schedule or the list of tasks, you will
need to click the Save button to save your changes. If you edit
yellow-background values in the task list, however, those changes will be
saved transparently; pressing the save button is not necessary.</P>
<HR>
<H2>Potential mistakes</H2>
<P>Be careful to avoid making the following mistakes when creating a
schedule:</P>
<P><B>Duplicate tasks</B>. Nothing currently prevents you from adding the
same task to your task list more than once. This could easily happen, for
example, if you add a task to your task list, then add its parent as well.
If you do this, the dashboard will dutifully create a schedule as if you
were performing the task twice.&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>Conflicts between different schedules</B>. The dashboard lets you
create multiple, independent schedules. It does not, however, offer any
support for time management when multiple schedules are running
concurrently. Nothing prevents you from creating twelve different
concurrent schedules, and promising to spend 40 hours per week on each.
Also, nothing prevents you from adding one task to multiple different
schedules.</P>
<P><B>Time estimates that don't add up</B>. The &quot;Planned Time&quot;
(PT) column should always add up in a hierarchical manner; that is, the
planned time for a parent node should always be equal to the sum of the
planned times for all its children. This is almost always the case for the
PSP processes that come with the dashboard. However, if you have <A
HREF="EnteringData.html#unlock">unlocked</A> your data and overwritten
calculations, times may no longer sum up correctly. When this occurs, the
task list will use the children's plan time for calculations rather than
the parent's.</P>
<P><B>Calendar starts too late</B>. If some of the tasks in your task list
were completed <I>before<B> </B></I>the start of the first time period in
your schedule, or if you have logged time to some of the tasks in your task
list <I>before<B> </B></I>the start of the first time period in your
schedule, then some of the earned value calculations will be incorrect. You
can easily spot this problem because the &quot;Actual&quot; lines for the
&quot;Earned Value&quot; and/or &quot;Direct Hours&quot; charts will not
start at zero.</P>
