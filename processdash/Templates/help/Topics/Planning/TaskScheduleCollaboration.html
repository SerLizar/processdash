<H1>Task &amp; Schedule Collaboration</H1>

<P>The <a href="UsingTaskSchedule.html">task and schedule tool</a>
contains built-in support for collaboration; just choose
Tools&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Collaborate.  The &quot;Task and Schedule
Collaboration Wizard&quot; will appear.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/TaskScheduleCollab.png"></p>

<p>The task &amp; schedule tool supports two different types of
collaboration.  It allows you to <a href="#publishing">publish</a> a
schedule (so other people can see it), and it allows you to <a
href="#rollup">roll-up</a> individual schedules to create a team
schedule.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> These collaboration features will typically only work
within a local area network.  In addition, they only work when the
dashboard is running.  See the <a href="#limitations">limitations</a>
section below for more information.</p>

<h2><a name="publishing"></a>Publishing Schedules</h2>

<p>Publishing a schedule opens up permissions so other people can view
the HTML earned value report. This is a great way to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Let co-workers who depend on your work know when they can expect
    it to be completed.</li>
  <li>Keep your manager or your customer apprised of your progress.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="publishPassword"></a>To publish your schedule, open it and
choose Tools&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Collaborate.  Then, click the Publish
button.  The
dashboard will give you an opportunity to set a password. Setting a
password prevents other people from viewing this schedule unless they
know the password. If this isn't a concern to you, you can choose not
to require a password. Passwords are set on a schedule-by-schedule
basis, so you can set different passwords for different schedules, or
set the password on one schedule but not another.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/TaskScheduleCollabPassword.png"></p>

<p><a name="publishFinish"></a>The dashboard will save your password
settings as soon as you click the Next button. It will then display a
final screen containing the URL, username, and password of the
published schedule. People will need this information to view the
published schedule, so you will need to send this information to
them. A hyperlink is provided that will help you to write an email
containing this information.</p>

<p>If you forget the URL or the password in the future, you can walk
through this process again.  Reopen the schedule, choose
Tools&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Collaborate, click the Publish button, and
you'll see the password screen
containing the configuration you set earlier. You can edit the
password settings if you wish, and your changes will be saved - or you
can just click Next without changing the password settings.  You will
once again be given the final screen with the URL/password, and the
hyperlink you can use to email that information.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> people will only be able to view the published
schedule while you have the dashboard running. For more information,
see the <a href="#limitations">limitations</a> section below.</p>

<h2><a name="rollup"></a>Rolling Up Schedules</h2>

<p>When two or more people are working on a project together, it is
very helpful to roll up each person's individual schedule to create a
team schedule. Creating a team schedule has many benefits:</p>

<ul>

  <li>It helps you to <b>track team progress</b>. You can easily
    determine whether the project is ahead or behind schedule, and
    over or under budget.</li>

  <li>It helps you to <b>forecast</b> the date when the overall
    project will most likely complete, as well as the total cost of
    the finished project.</li>

  <li>It helps to <b>balance the project workload</b>. Despite your
    best planning efforts, you usually find that someone on the team
    has too many tasks assigned to them. Reassigning tasks so that
    everyone is forecast to finish at the same time is called
    &quot;balancing the schedule.&quot;</li>

</ul>

<p>Rolling up schedules is a two-step process: first, each individual
must &quot;<a href="#sharing">share</a>&quot; their schedule. Then,
someone must create a master &quot;<a href="#createRollup">roll-up</a>&quot;
schedule.</p>

<h3 NO_NUMBER><a name="sharing"></a>Sharing Schedules</h3>

<p><a name="sharePassword"></a>To share your schedule, open it and
choose Tools&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Collaborate.  Then, click the Share button. The
dashboard will give you an opportunity to set a sharing
password. Setting a password prevents other people from adding this
schedule to a master schedule unless they know the password. If this
isn't a concern to you, you can choose not to require a
password. Passwords are set on a schedule-by-schedule basis, so you
can set different passwords for different schedules, or set the
password on one schedule but not another.</p>

<p><a name="shareFinish"></a>The dashboard will save your password
settings as soon as you click the Next button. It will then display a
final screen containing the password and the URL of the shared
schedule.  <a name="emailShareInfo"></a>You need to send this
information to the person who is creating the master
&quot;roll-up&quot; schedule. A hyperlink is provided that will help
you to email the information to that person.</p>

<p>If you forget the URL or the password in the future, you can walk
through this process again.  Reopen the schedule, choose
Tools&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Collaborate, click the Share button, and
you'll see the password screen
containing the configuration you set earlier. You can edit the
password settings if you wish, and your changes will be saved - but
realize that changing the password will break any roll-ups that
contain this schedule. To avoid that problem, just click Next without
changing the password settings. You will once again be given the final
screen with the URL/password, and the hyperlink you can use to email
that information.</p>

<h3 NO_NUMBER><a name="createRollup"></a>Creating a Roll-up Schedule</h3>

<p>One person on the team should create a master schedule which
roll-ups all of the individual schedules to the team level. Since that
person usually has their own individual schedule as well, the
dashboard is designed to create the rollup schedule and add their
individual schedule all in one step.</p>

<p>To create the roll-up schedule, open your personal schedule and
choose Tools&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Collaborate.  Then, click the Rollup button. The
dashboard will allow you to choose a name for the resulting roll-up
schedule. When you click the Next button, the dashboard will create
the new roll-up schedule and add your personal schedule to it. When
you click the Finish button, the dashboard will open the new roll-up
schedule it just created.</p>

<p>Now, you will want to add additional schedules to the roll-up. Just
click the Add Schedule button to display the Add Schedule dialog
box. This dialog lists all of your personal schedules - you can add
one or more of them if you wish.  However, you will generally just
want to select the "Import a shared schedule..."  option. It will
prompt you for the URL and password of the shared schedule you wish to
add. This is information you need to get from your co-workers -
hopefully they emailed it to you as described
<a href="#emailShareInfo">above</a>.  Copy the information from the email
into the fields provided, and click OK. At this point, the dashboard
will connect to your co-worker's dashboard and retrieve the shared
schedule. If it cannot retrieve the shared schedule, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Contact your co-worker to make certain that they have the
    dashboard running.</li>

  <li>Double-check that they sent you the right URL and password, and
    that they haven't changed the password since they sent it to you.</li>

  <li>Try adding the shared schedule again. If these steps don't solve
    the problem, you may need to take a look at the
    <a href="#limitations">limitations</a> section below.</li>
</ul>

<p>After retrieving the shared schedule, the dashboard will give you
an opportunity to designate a &quot;local name&quot; for it. By
default, it uses the name of the remote schedule, followed by the name
of the person who created the schedule. (This allows you to tell
schedules apart, since they might otherwise have very similar names.)
The shared schedule will appear in the master schedule by the
&quot;local name&quot; you designate.</p>

<p>If you add a schedule by mistake, you can remove it by highlighting
it and clicking the Remove Schedule button.</p>

<ul>

  <li><b>Tip:</b> if someone changes the password on their shared
    schedule, you can correct the problem by removing that schedule
    from the master schedule, and adding it back again with the new
    password.</li>

</ul>

<p>The Move Schedule Up and Move Schedule Down buttons can be used to
rearrange the list of schedules. Note that this will not change any of
the roll-up calculations, since these calculations are independent of
the order of the list.</p>

<p>Your co-workers will probably want to be able to see the roll-up
schedule you just created. Simply open the roll-up schedule, choose
Tools&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Collaborate, and click Publish. See the section <a
href="#publishing">above</a> on publishing for additional
instructions. It is not currently possible to add one rollup schedule
to another rollup schedule, so the Share and Rollup buttons will be
disabled when you open the &quot;Task and Schedule Collaboration
Wizard&quot; from a rollup schedule.</p>

<h2><a name="limitations"></a>Constraints and Limitations</h2>

To understand the constraints of these collaboration features, it is
helpful to understand how the features work.

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/TaskScheduleCollabArchitecture.png"></p>

<p>When you publish a schedule, the dashboard acts as a web server
that your co-workers can connect to with their web browser.  Their web
browser communicates to your dashboard to see the published
schedule.</p>

<p>Similarly, when you share a schedule, the dashboard acts as a
server that your co-worker's dashboard can connect to.  The dashboard
that is computing the roll-up schedule connects to your dashboard and
retrieves the latest copy of your schedule in a peer-to-peer
fashion.</p>

<p>As a result, your dashboard must be running for the collaboration
features to work.  If your dashboard is not running when a co-worker
tries to look at your published schedule, they will instead see an
error page stating "Cannot find server or DNS Error."</p>

<p>Rollup schedules keep a locally cached copy of your schedule, to
enable calculating a rollup even when your dashboard isn't running.
The rollup schedule will attempt to retrieve a recent version of your
schedule.  If your dashboard is not running, it will calculate the
rollup using the most recent version it has cached.</p>

<p>The collaboration features rely on TCP/IP connectivity and DNS resolution
to work. Because of this, you will probably need to be on the same network as
your co-worker, manager, and/or customer.  If someone is on a different
network than you (especially if there is a firewall between your computer and
theirs), they may not be able to take advantage of any collaboration
features you have enabled.</p>

<p>Most of the time, you interact with the dashboard web server by viewing
web pages that begin with "http://localhost".  This works fine when the
dashboard and the web browser are both running on the same computer. For the
collaboration features to work, however, your co-workers need a web address
that begins with the DNS name of your computer. Therefore, the dashboard
automatically ascertains the name of your computer and uses that to construct
collaboration URLs.  This process should work 99% of the time. If, however,
the dashboard deduces an incorrect name for your computer, then no one
will be able to use the collaboration URLs you send them.  If this occurs,
you should ask your system administrator for the DNS name of your computer,
and use it to set the "http.hostname" setting in the
<a href="../AdvancedTopics/ConfigurationFile.html">preferences editor</a>.
