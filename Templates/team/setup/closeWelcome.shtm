<p>When a project is finished or cancelled, your team will often hold
a retrospective to review project data and collect lessons learned. As
part of this effort, you may wish to mark the project as
<b><u>closed</u></b>.</p>

<p>Marking a project as "closed" has the following effects:</p>

<ul>

<li>When team members run a "Sync to WBS" operation in their personal
dashboard, it will offer to close all of the in-progress tasks in
their plan, and remove all of the tasks they haven't started yet.</li>

<li>Once all team members have performed the step above, the team
reports will show the project as being 100% complete.</li>

<li>Team members will still be able to enter missing data for the
project (for example, to record defects, capture actual size, or fill
in forgotten time log entries).  They will also be able to edit their
existing data to correct any mistakes they find.  They can request an
"Export My Data" operation to push these changes to the Team
Dashboard.</li>

<li><b>However</b>, if team members use the play/pause buttons to log
time against project tasks, they will see a message warning them that
the tasks in question have been marked complete. (This can help them
to avoid collecting new time log data accidentally.)</li>

<li>If team members open the Work Breakdown Structure for the project,
they will see a message warning them that the project has been marked
complete, and that no additional work should be performed here.  (This
can help them to avoid creating new tasks in the project by accident.)
If they do create new tasks in the WBS, those changes will have no
effect. (The new tasks will not be copied down into their personal
plan for the closed project.)</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Note:</b> if the work on this project is ongoing, but you simply
wish to close this project cycle and begin a new cycle, it is more
helpful to <a href="relaunchWelcome.shtm">relaunch</a> the project
instead.</p>

<p>Would you like to mark the "<tt><!--#echo var=PATH_TRANSLATED --></tt>"
project as <b><u>closed</u></b>?</p>
