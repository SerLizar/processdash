<h1>Plan Overall Project Strategy</h1>
<b>(TSP Launch Meeting No. 3)</b>

<p>One of the first tasks in your project launch will be to create
your overall project strategy. The dashboard provides powerful tools
in support of this task.</p>

<ol>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>Your project strategy begins with a
conceptual design. To promote the free flow of ideas, it is often a
good idea to use a whiteboard, easel, and other traditional meeting
aids to capture the team's ideas.</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>As the conceptual design begins to take
shape, you will begin to identify the main components / features of
the product to be produced, or the main categories of work to be
performed. These items will ultimately become the top-level entries in
your project WBS. While the team continues to capture these on a
whiteboard, it is helpful to have one person copy these into the
dashboard's Work Breakdown Structure Editor in real-time. To open the
Work Breakdown Structure Editor, select the Edit Work Breakdown
Structure option from the script menu for the team project.

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>If this team project is a member of a
master project, the master project leader may have outlined a set of
high-level components that you should use as the basis for your
conceptual design.  As you enter your conceptual design into the WBS,
you should align the tasks you create underneath the appropriate
high-level components from the master project whenever it makes sense
to do so.</li>


<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>The Work Breakdown Structure Editor
displays your hierarchical work breakdown structure (WBS) on the
left. Tabs on the right hand side of the screen provide access to
various collections of project planning metrics. During the conceptual
design process, you will primarily use the hierarchical list on the
left-hand side. If you need more space to view this hierarchical list,
simply drag the <i>splitter bar</i> to the right.</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>The WBS is displayed in outline
format. To create a new item in the WBS, just press Enter or
Insert. Click on the name of an item to edit it. To arrange items
hierarchically, press Tab or Shift-Tab to change their indentation
within the outline. You will find many of these tasks repeated on the
toolbar and the Edit menu. For more in-depth information, see the
section below titled, &quot;Editing the Work Breakdown
Structure.&quot;</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>Most of the items you enter during
conceptual design will be software components. These items appear in
the WBS with a small floppy disk icon (<img border=0 width=13
height=13 src="../Images/icon-floppy.png">). If your conceptual
design includes documents or tasks, you can alter the type of an item
by clicking on the icon. A menu will appear that you can use to change
the WBS item type.</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>To complete the conceptual design, the
team typically produces rough size estimates for each item in the
WBS. You can enter this data by selecting the Size tab on the
right-hand side of the screen. The sizes of software components should
be estimated in lines of code (LOC), and documents should be estimated
in pages. If you have created any tasks in your conceptual design, you
can enter a size metric of your own choosing in the Units column.</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>With rough size estimates in place, your
team is ready to determine its overall project development
strategy. One component of this strategy will be the list of items you
wish to include in the upcoming project phase or cycle. If your plan
includes large software components that will be developed over
multiple iterations, you may wish to hierarchically subdivide them to
mirror this decision.
