<h1>Exploring Alternative Plans</h1>

During team project planning, it is often necessary to explore trade-offs
between cost, schedule, and scope - for example, to propose several
alternative plans to management.  And later during the execution of the team
project, it may be necessary to explore "what if" scenarios - for example, to
determine the potential impact of a major change to the team plan.  There are
two possible ways to accomplish these types of tasks.</p>


<h2>Option 1: Saving Multiple Alternative Plans</h2>

The WBS Editor offers a comprehensive facility for saving and editing multiple
independent, alternative plans.  To create an alternative plan, choose
"File&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Save a Copy."  This will save a ZIP file containing a
complete copy of your plan (including the WBS, team member list, workflows,
and milestones).  You can save as many copies as you like, each in a separate
ZIP file.

<p>Then, you can choose "File&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Open" in the WBS Editor window
to open one of these alternative plans.  (You can also open an alternative
plan by dragging and dropping the ZIP file onto the Quick Launcher window.)  A
second WBS Editor window will open to show the data from the selected ZIP
file.  The name of the ZIP file will be displayed in the title bar of this
window to distinguish it from your "official" project plan.  You can edit this
alternative plan, and the colored balancing bars will show the projected date
when the alternative plan might finish.  The "File&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Save"
option will write your changes back into the ZIP file.</p>

<p>After exploring alternative plans and presenting them to management, you
may select a particular plan that the team intends to follow.  In the Team
Dashboard, select your team project from the tree on the left, and click
the option from the list on the right to open the WBS for your project.
Then choose "File&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Replace Data."  A warning dialog will be
displayed.  Read the warning information carefully and press the "Yes" button
to confirm.  Then select the ZIP file containing your team's chosen
alternative plan.  Your team's WBS, team member list, workflows, and
milestones will be replaced with the data read from the ZIP file.  Review the
new data to make sure you selected the correct ZIP file, then choose
"File&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Save" to commit this as the official plan for your
team project.</p>


<h2>Option 2: Exploring Scope/Schedule Tradeoffs Using Milestones</h2>

The "Save a Copy" feature described above provides a lot of power for
exploring arbitrary plan alternatives; but if your alternative plans center
around tradeoffs between scope and schedule, a simpler technique may be
more convenient for your team.

<p>This technique leverages the power of milestones to explore scope changes.
To use this technique, open the Milestones window.  If you do not already have
a milestone representing the actual project delivery, create one.  In
addition, create a new milestone for each deliverable that could potentially
be moved in and out of scope.  (Selecting the "Hide" checkbox for these
optional deliverables may be helpful.)</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/milestone-scope-example-1.png"></p>

<p>Back in the WBS Editor, use the Milestone column on the Task Details tab to
tag components and tasks that fall under the scope of each of these optional
deliverables.  Use the "Final Delivery" milestone as a catch-all to tag the
components and tasks that must be completed, but that do not belong to any
other milestone.  One way to declare this "catch-all" is to set "Final
Delivery" as the milestone for the first row in the WBS (the row that
represents the overall team project).</p>

<p>Once milestones are assigned, click on the Milestones menu and select the
option to "Balance Work Through" the "Final Delivery" milestone.</p>

<p>With these changes in place, you can now open the Milestones window and
change the order of the "Optional Scope" milestones relative to "Final
Delivery."  (You can use the Move Up/Move Down operations on the toolbar to
change the relative order of the milestones in the list.)</p>

<ul>

<li>If you place an optional milestone at the end of the list, after "Final
Delivery," the balancing bars will now show date projections as if that
deliverable had been moved out of scope.  Moving it back up above "Final
Delivery" will move it back into scope.  (This "magic" is occurring because we
told the WBS to balance work through "Final Delivery," so subsequent
milestones are being temporarily excluded from our balancing bar
calculation.)</li>

<li>This same technique can be used to explore the possibility of moving items
in and out of scope for various project iterations or other milestones.  Place
an optional item above the row for a real project milestone to indicate that
the optional item is part of the scope for that milestone.  (The optional item
is placed <u>above</u> the real milestone to indicate that it must be
completed <u>before</u> the milestone will be considered complete.)</li>

</ul>

<p>The image below demonstrates Optional Scope Item #1 being accomplished as
part of the work for the "Iteration 2 Release," and the Optional Scope Item #2
being moved out of scope for the entire project.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/milestone-scope-example-2.png"></p>

<p>As you reorder these milestones, the colored balancing bars will
dynamically update to display new projections that take your scope changes
into account. </p>

<p>When you present your alternative plans to management, they may agree to
remove some of these optional items from the project scope.  When you receive
this direction, move the optional scope item to the end of the milestones
list, and click the "Defer Sync" checkbox.  This will tell the dashboard not
to copy the related tasks into team members' personal plans.</p>
