<H1>Accessing the Process Scripts</H1>
Most of the scripts necessary to perform your work are already included in 
the Process Dashboard.  In particular, the process scripts for all of the PSP 
levels described in <I>A Discipline for Software Engineering</I> are included.</P>

<P>To access process scripts, hit the script button on the dashboard.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../../Images/PointToScriptButton.jpg">

<P>This will start (if necessary) a web browser and point it at an 
appropriate process script based on which process stage is currently active.</P>

<P>This example shows a project calling up the Planning script for PSP level 0.</P>

<P>The dashboard attempts to determine which script is likely to be most 
helpful given your current phase of activity.  The current phase of activity 
is determined by the completion status of the phases of the current running 
process template (PSP0, PSP0.1, etc.).  For info on marking phases as 
complete, see <A HREF="CompletionButton.html">The completion button</A> help 
topic.  Most of the online forms allow you to navigate back to the "top" of 
the set of process scripts by a link labelled "Top".  Also, a link which will 
take you on to the next phase in the given process is usually shown as 
well.</P>
