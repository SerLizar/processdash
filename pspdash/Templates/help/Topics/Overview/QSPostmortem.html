<h1>Step 7: Postmortem</h1>

<P>The PSP provides Postmortem scripts for all of the PSP levels.  To get to 
the postmortem for the current program, we can click the link at the bottom 
of the development script.  Also, clicking the script button on the dashboard 
while in the postmortem phase will bring up the postmortem script, or using 
the pull-down control on the scripts button will display an option for the postmortem script as well.</p>

<P>After making sure that the entry criteria are met, the next step that must 
be done is to enter the actual size data for the program.  Actual values for 
base, deleted, modified, total, base additions, new and reused LOC can be 
entered on the Size Estimating Template form, which can be reached by 
clicking the appropriate link from the postmortem script. The data entered 
into the Size Estimating Template will automatically be reflected in the 
Project Plan Summary form, as well.</p>

<P>Once the actual size information (including measures of reuse) has been 
entered on the Size Estimating Template form, we can mark the postmortem 
phase complete. Once all the phases in the process have been marked 
complete, the dashboard will mark the project itself complete as well.  We 
can double check that it has been marked by looking at the Project Completion 
checkbox on the Project Plan Summary.</p>

<p>If the Project Complete checkbox had not been automatically checked, it 
would indicate that we had already overridden this automatic behavior.  You 
can learn more about the relationship between marking the phases complete and 
marking the entire project complete by reading the <a 
href="../Execution/CompletionButton.html">Using the completion checkbox</a> 
help topic.</p>

<p>At the end of this project, the entire Project Plan Summary form looks 
like this.</p>

<P>The Process Dashboard also offers several other aids for analyzing 
postmortem data.  Choosing Data Analysis from the "C" menu will open the web 
browser to a set of pages that contain many useful graphs of process data.</P>

<p><center><img src="../../Images/QSDataAnalysis.png"></center></p>

<P>This Data Analysis page provides several different categories of charts to 
allow easy analysis of various metrics measured in the PSP.  Clicking on one 
of the chart thumbnails in the right pane will bring up a full-sized view of 
that chart.  For more information on the types of data that can be analyzed 
via these reports and graphs, see the <a 
href="../PostmortemAnalysis/DataChartsAndReports.html">Creating Reports and 
Charts</a> help topic.</p>

<P>That's it for this example.  We hope it has been helpful.</p>
