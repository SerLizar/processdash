<h1>Preparing for a Team Project Launch</h1>

<p>When you begin a new team project, it is necessary to create and
configure a new project in the Team Process Dashboard.</p>

<p>Although this process is normally simple, some teams may find that
additional steps are required - especially for their very first team
project.  In particular, you may need to work with your local IT
support staff to resolve organization-specific technical issues.</p>

<p>The team launch is an extremely intensive planning session - you
don't have time to be distracted by technical issues.  So it is
strongly recommended that you make the preparations described in the
topics below <b>before</b> your project launch begins.  You can
perform these steps as far in advance as you like.</p>
