<h1>Troubleshooting Network Connectivity</h1>

<p>The Team Dashboard provides many services to team members, such as
the ability to join a team project or view the team project
plan. These services are generally reached by pointing your Web
browser at an appropriate URL.</p>

<p>If you are unable to view a URL given to you by your team leader,
try the steps below to resolve the problem.</p>

<ol>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>Contact your team leader and ensure that
(a)&nbsp;the Team Dashboard is running, and (b)&nbsp;the computer
running the Team Dashboard is connected to the network. If your team
leader verifies that the Team Dashboard is running and its computer is
connected to the network, but you still cannot connect, continue to
the next step.</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>Take a look at the URL you are
attempting to visit. It will look something like this:

<pre style="margin-left:1cm">http://<span style='background:yellow'>team-computer</span>:3000/...</pre>

The URL will begin with the characters &quot;<tt>http://</tt>&quot;
and will then have the name of your team leader's computer, followed
by a colon (<tt>:</tt>) and a number. The team computer name may
include several words separated by periods (<tt>.</tt>). Copy down
this <i>team computer name</i>, as the steps below will require
it.</li>


<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>Many organizations require their
employees to use a proxy server when accessing the Internet. If your
Web browser attempts to use a proxy server to contact your team
leader's computer, it is likely to fail. Ensure that your Web browser
is properly configured.

    <ul>

    <li>If you are using <b>Internet Explorer</b>, choose Tools&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Internet Options. Select the
    Connections tab and click the LAN Settings button. Then ensure
    that the <i>Bypass proxy server for local addresses</i> box is
    checked.

    <p class="figure"><img src="../Images/proxy-ie.png"></p></li>


    <li>If you are using <b>Netscape</b> or <b>Mozilla</b>, choose
    Edit&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Preferences. Open the
    Advanced&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Proxies preference page, and add the
    team computer name to the <i>No Proxy for:</i> field.

    <p class="figure"><img src="../Images/proxy-moz.png"></p></li>

    </ul>

After making this configuration change in your browser, try refreshing
the page in your browser.  If it still does not appear, continue to
the next step.</li>


<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>To determine whether your computer can
contact the team leader's computer, open up a command prompt window,
and type the following command:

<pre style="margin-left:1cm">ping <span style='background:yellow'>team-computer</span></pre>

replacing the highlighted letters with the name of the team computer
you copied from the team project URL.

    <ul>

    <li style="margin-top:12pt">If you see a message like,


    <pre style="margin-left:1cm">Reply from 10.20.30.41: bytes=32 time&lt;10ms TTL=128</pre>

    then more serious network connectivity issues are most likely
    to blame. Contact your local IT support staff for help.</li>


    <li style="margin-top:12pt">If you see this message,

    <pre style="margin-left:1cm">Unknown host <span style='background:yellow'>team-computer</span></pre>

    then your computer is having trouble finding the IP address of the
    team computer.  You may be able to work around the problem by
    using an IP address directly.  Contact your local support staff
    and ask them to help you look up the IP address of your team
    leader's computer - it will be a number like
    <tt>10.20.30.40</tt>. Then edit the URL you are trying to visit,
    replacing the computer name with the IP address:

    <pre style="margin-left:1cm">http://<span style='background:yellow'>10.20.30.40</span>:3000/...</pre>

    </li>


    <li style="margin-top:12pt">If you see this message,

    <pre style="margin-left:1cm">Request timed out.</pre>

    then there is no network connectivity between your computer and
    the team leader's computer. If the team leader indicates that
    their computer <b><u>is connected</u></b> to the network, then
    more serious network connectivity issues are most likely to
    blame. Contact your local IT support staff for help.</li>

    </ul>

</li>

</ol>
