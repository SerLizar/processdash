<H1>How the Dashboard finds process files</H1>

<!-- How to define your own custom process
   * An overview of the process definition architecture: explain the three
     pieces to the puzzle and how they fit together:
      * "-template.xml" files define the *structure* of the process
      * optional HTML files provide process scripts and forms
      * optional data files define custom calculations for your process
     Also explain how the dashboard locates these files (i.e., where should
     you put these files, and how can you share them with your co-workers) -->
