<H1>Using the Defect Log Editor</H1>

<P>You can use the defect log editor to correct mistakes you might make when 
entering defects.</P>

<p><img src="../../Images/DefectLogEditor.png"></p>


<P>The left pane shows the current project hierarchy.  Picking various 
branches on the hierarchy will limit the defect entries displayed to just 
those on the branch chosen.</P>

<P>To change data in the defect entries, just pick on the element that you 
would like to change.  When a particular defect entry is picked, the Edit 
button becomes active.  Clicking the Edit button will bring up the same 
dialog box used to enter defects.  All the defect data can be changed using 
this dialog.  For help using the defect entry dialog please see the <a 
href="EnteringDefects.html">Entering defects</A> help topic.</P>
