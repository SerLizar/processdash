<h1>Process Dashboard Mobile Companion App</h1>

<p>A mobile/smartphone application is available for use with the Process
Dashboard.</p>

<p>The mobile app works alongside the Process Dashboard, making it possible to
perform a number of common tasks from an iPhone<sup>&reg;</sup>,
iPad<sup>&reg;</sup>, or Android<sup style="font-size:60%">TM</sup>
device:</p>

<ul>

<li>Reviewing the list of tasks you're responsible for</li>

<li>Logging task time, and editing past time logs</li>

<li>Updating the estimated time for a task</li>

<li>Marking tasks complete</li>

</ul>

<p>The data you collect in the app is automatically synchronized with data in
the Process Dashboard, and vice-versa.</p>

<p>The mobile application <b>does not replace</b> the Process Dashboard.  You
will still need to open the Process Dashboard program on your computer to
export your data for team rollups, and to perform other project related tasks.
Still, the app can be useful for collecting project data when you are away
from your computer.</p>

<p>To get started using the mobile application, click the Next button
below.</p>
