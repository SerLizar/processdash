<H1>Using the play/pause button</H1>

<P>The play/pause button gives access to the timer that is built into the 
dashboard.</P>

<p><img src="../../Images/ShowPlayPauseButton.jpg"></p>

<P>By using the dashboard timer, you can measure the amount of time spent in 
the various phases of your development process.</P>

<P>By default, the play/pause button shows a triangle when the timer <em>IS 
NOT</em> running.  The intent is that the picture shows what will happen when 
it is pressed (pressing the play button will cause the timer to start).  Once 
pressed, the button image changes from the triangle to a pair of vertical 
bars.  When the vertical bars are displayed, the timer <em>IS</em> running.  
Again, the intent is to show what will happen when the button is pressed at 
this point (pressing the pause button will cause the timer to pause).</P>

 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD>Dashboard timer waiting to be started</TD>
  <TD>Dashboard timer running</TD>
 </TR>
</TABLE></P>

<P>If you would prefer to see the triangle when the timer <em>IS</em> 
currently running (i.e. you would rather see the current state of the timer 
on the button), you can override this default behavior by adding an entry to 
the configuration file.  Adding the following line to the configuration file 
will cause the play and pause symbols to reverse their meaning:</P>

<pre>pauseButton.showCurrent=true</pre>

<P>For more information about the configuration file see the <a 
href="../AdvancedTopics/ConfigurationFile.html">configuration file</a> help 
topic.</P>

<P>When you start the timer, it will make a short "clicking" sound to let
you know it is timing you.  You can leave the timer running as you move
from phase to phase and project to project, and it will play the "timing
sound" as you navigate to each new project/phase.  Once again, the sound is
there to remind you that the dashboard is timing you; the sound will
<b>not</b> play if the timer is not running.  Therefore, as you move from
one project/phase to another, if you expect to hear the sound and do not
(or vice versa), check the state of the timer.</p>

<h2>The play/pause button pull-down control</h2>
<P>The play/pause button contains a pull-down control that can be used to 
quickly jump to any point on the project tree that has had time recorded in 
it.  This provides another way of navigating to a project or project phase in 
which you were recently working.</p>
