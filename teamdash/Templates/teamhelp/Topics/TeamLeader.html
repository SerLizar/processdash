<h1>Team Management (Team Leader, Managers)</h1>

<p>As a member of the team, the team leader may need to use his or her
<i>personal</i> Process Dashboard dataset to perform project tasks,
following the general instructions provided above for all team members.  In
contrast, the Team Dashboard requires minimal attention and requires no
data entry.  When running, it provides many useful features for project
planning and tracking.</p>
