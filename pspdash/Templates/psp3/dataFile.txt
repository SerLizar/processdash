== Description: This is the data file for a PSP3 process.

== The following elements identify the data in this file as belonging to
== a PSP3 process.

psp3==1.0

psp2.1==null
PSP2.1==null


== NEEDS WORK: how should (time/defect) estimates be made for HLD?
== Check for guidance from PSP book.  Currently, my best guess would
== be to use a linear relationship based on time/defects per N&C KLOC.

== Two new phases: High Level Design and High Level Design Review
==
