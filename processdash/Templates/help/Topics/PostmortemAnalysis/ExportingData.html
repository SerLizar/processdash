<H1>Exporting Data</H1>

<H2>Exporting Team Project Data</H2>

<p>If you are participating on a team project, the dashboard will
automatically export your team project data on a periodic basis.  However,
there may be times that you wish to publish your latest data immediately (for
example, if you are on your way to a team meeting).  Just click the script
menu and choose the "Export My Data Now" option.</p>

<H2>Advanced: Exporting Non-Project Data</H2>

<p>If you have been collecting data that is not part of a team project,
you can export that data if you wish.  Just
choose &quot;Tools&nbsp;<img src="../../Images/rarrow.png">&nbsp;Export&quot;
from the <a href="../Execution/ConfigureMenu.html">configuration menu</a>.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/ExportWizardStart.png"></p>

<p>To export data, choose the "Export Project Metrics" option. The
following page will be displayed:</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/ExportWizardMetrics.png"></p>

<p>This screen allows you to choose the file where data will be exported,
and the projects in your hierarchy that should be included in the export.
When you click "Next", data for the selected projects will be exported to
the designated file.  This will include metrics data (e.g. the data visible
on the plan summary form), defect data (e.g. the data visible in the defect
log), and earned value data (if any of the selected projects are contained
in any earned value task lists).</p>

<p>If you would like this data to be exported automatically each time
the dashboard shuts down, choose "Yes" on the final checkbox.  This
will add this export operation to a permanent list of automatic
exports.  You can view that list, and alter its contents, by choosing
the "Manage Automatic Exports" option on the initial page of the Data
Export Wizard.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/ExportWizardManage.png"></p>

<p><b>Advanced:</b> Individuals who are interested in viewing/reusing
the data in these exported files are free to do so; the export file is
a simple ZIP archive with XML files inside.  Keep in mind, however,
that this file format is subject to change in future versions of the
dashboard.</p>

<H1>Importing Data</H1>

<p>Files that have been exported by the dashboard (as described above)
can be imported by the Data Import Wizard.  To open the Data Import Wizard,
choose &quot;Tools&nbsp;<img src="../../Images/rarrow.png">&nbsp;Import&quot;
from the <a href="../Execution/ConfigureMenu.html">configuration menu</a>.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/ImportWizardStart.png"></p>

<p>To import data, choose the "Import Project Metrics" option.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/ImportWizardMetrics.png"></p>

<p>This screen allows you to choose a directory containing files that
should be imported.  The directory will be scanned for files previously
exported by the dashboard (such files should have the ".pdash" suffix).
The data in the files will be imported into the dashboard's data repository
with the prefix chosen.</p>

<p>Metrics data imported in this way will be visible to tools like
<a href="../Planning/UsingProbeWizard.html">PROBE</a>, the
<a href="DataChartsAndReports.html#charts">Data Analysis Center</a>, and
<a href="../AdvancedTopics/MultipleToDateData.html">data rollup templates</a>.
Earned value data imported in this way can be added to 
<a href="../Planning/UsingTaskSchedule.html#createNew">earned value
roll-ups</a>.  This provides many possibilities for rolling up data to the
team level, and for analyzing data trends across projects.</p>

<p>If you would like the data to be imported the next time the dashboard
starts, select Yes on the final checkbox.  This will add the import
operation to a permanent list of automatic imports. You can view that list,
and alter its contents, by choosing the "Manage Automatic Imports" option
on the initial page of the Data Import Wizard.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/ImportWizardManage.png"></p>

<h1><a name="excel"></a>Exporting data to Excel (PC only)</h1>
<p>Many of the reporting forms in the dashboard have links that say "Export 
to Excel...".  When this link is clicked, an Excel sheet will come up that 
contains the data from that form.</p>

<p>By default, the data will be exported <b>dynamically</b> as a linked
workbook.  When the workbook opens, Excel will connect to the dashboard and
retrieve the data items.  At any time, you can ask Excel to refresh the data
by right-clicking on the data and choosing "Refresh."  This dynamic refresh
behavior can be very powerful.  For example, you can create additional sheets
in the workbook to analyze and chart the raw data, then save the workbook.  In
the future, you can make sure the dashboard is running, reopen this workbook,
and ask Excel to refresh the data.  Excel will reload the raw data and your
charts will update.</p>

<p><A NAME="static"></A>In some web browsers, that dynamic behavior may not
work properly.  In that case, you can try switching to a <b>static</b> export.
The static export will show the values of process variables at the instant
that the export was done.  For instructions on configuring for static
exports, see the <A
HREF="../Troubleshooting/FAQ.html#BadExcel">related FAQ</A>.</p>

<P>The "Export to Excel..." option will appear on 
<UL>
 <li><a href="../Planning/EnteringData.html">dashboard forms</a> such as
   the Project Plan Summary form</li>
 <li>tables that are displayed by clicking on a graphical chart (see <a 
   href="DataChartsAndReports.html#charts">Data Charts and Reports</a> for
   more information)</li>
 <li>the table that is displayed when you click on the "historical data" link 
   from a PSP1.0 or higher process script</li>
 <li>the HTML time log</li>
 <li>the HTML defect log</li>
 <li>the HTML report that is displayed when you click the
  &quot;Report&quot; button on the <A
  HREF="../Planning/UsingTaskSchedule.html">task &amp; schedule tool</A></li>
 <li>...and many other reports</li>
</ul>

<h1><a name="importPSP"></a>Importing Historical PSP Data</h1>

<p>If you have PSP data from historical projects, and you would like to import
them into the dashboard so they contribute to your &quot;To Date&quot; data,
PROBE calculations, and &quot;Data Analysis&quot; charts/reports, you can use
the &quot;Import PSP Data&quot; template.&nbsp; To enter your
historical data into the dashboard, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>

  <li>Open the <a href="../Planning/UsingHierarchyEditor.html">Hierarchy
    Editor</a>.</li>

  <li>Highlight a node in your hierarchy like "Non Project", then click
    &quot;Edit&nbsp;<img src="../../Images/rarrow.png" border="0" width="12"
    height="9"> Add Template&nbsp;<img src="../../Images/rarrow.png"
    border="0" width="12" height="9"> Import PSP Data&quot;.  <i>(If there is
    no "Import PSP Data" option in your "Add Template" menu, then you may
    need to <a href="../Overview/ProcessScripts.html#psp">install the PSP
    scripts and forms</a>.)</i>
    A new node will be created in your hierarchy. Give it a descriptive name;
    you might choose names like "Program 1" if you are entering data from a
    PSP course.</li>

  <li>Repeat step 2 for each PSP project whose data you wish to import.</li>

  <li>Choose &quot;File&nbsp;<img src="../../Images/rarrow.png" border="0"
    width="12" height="9"> Save&quot;, then &quot;File&nbsp;<img
    src="../../Images/rarrow.png" border="0" width="12" height="9">
    Close&quot; to close the hierarchy editor.</li>

  <li>Navigate to one of the projects you just created, then click the script
    button.  An abbreviated project plan summary will appear. The fields on
    this summary are editable; enter your historical data for the given
    project.</li>

  <li>Repeat step 5 for each imported project.</li>

</ol>

<p>The data entry is a manual process, but not a time-consuming one; it
should be possible to enter the data from an entire PSP course in about 15
minutes.</p>
