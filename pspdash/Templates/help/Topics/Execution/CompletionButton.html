<H1>Using the completion checkbox</H1>

<P>As you complete the activities for a given process phase, you should mark
that phase as completed via the completion checkbox.</P>

<p><center><img src="../../Images/PointToCompletionButton.png"></center></p>

<P>When the completion checkbox is pressed, the dashboard moves the current 
phase to the next phase prescribed by the running process template.  If the 
timer is currently running, it will automatically stop recording time for the 
given phase and start the timing of the next phase.  For more information on 
using the timer, see the <a href="PlayPause.html">Using the Play/Pause 
button</A> help topic.</P>

<P>Phases marked as complete will show a little checkmark in the completion 
checkbox.  (If you hover the mouse over the checked box, the tooltip will tell
you exactly what date and time the phase was marked complete.)</P>

<P>This example shows the Design phase of a PSP0 project marked as 
complete.</P>

<P>If you need to go back to a previous phase in a given process, you can 
still do so even if the completion checkbox has been pressed.  The dashboard 
will still accumulate time in whatever phase you make current.</P>

<p>By default, a <B>project</B> will be considered complete when all the <B>phases</B>
in the project have been marked complete. However, if you manually edit the
project completion date on the plan summary form, you have manually
overridden this behavior.&nbsp; From then on, the project completion status
must be edited manually; it will no longer respond to changes in phase
completion status.</p>

<P>It is worth remembering that the "To Date" data entries, the data analysis
reports, and the PROBE tool only use data from <B> projects</B> that are marked
complete, so it is good to make a habit of marking your projects complete,
either with the completion checkbox or via the Project Plan Summary form.</p>

<P>Also remember that the task and schedule tool tracks your progress by
looking to see which <B>tasks</B> have been marked complete, so it is good
to make a habit of marking phases complete. To help you keep track of what
has and hasn't been marked complete, the hierarchy menus will display a
checkmark to the right of completed tasks.</p>
