<p>The team-oriented processes in the dashboard use a <b>shared network
&quot;team directory&quot;</b> to facilitate coordination.  This directory
will be used to hold team-level planning information, such as the project's
work breakdown structure.  It will also hold exported snapshots of individual
data, for use in computing team reports.</p>

<p>The &quot;team directory&quot; must be <b>accessible, readable, and
writable by all team members</b>.  Because of this, it needs to be a shared
network directory.  Since the directory will hold personal data collected by
individuals, it should be configured with permissions that forbid file access
by non-team members.<p>

<td>The Process Dashboard was designed to use shared network directories
because they are commonly available in a vast majority of organizations.
However, they are not a perfect fit for every organization.  If you cannot
create a shared directory that all team members can access, an alternative is
available. <a target="_blank"

<p>Any number of projects can share the same team directory; the
process dashboard will still be able to track which data belongs to
which project.  (This is true even if the projects are using different
team processes.)  Thus, if you have a team which is performing several
projects (or project phases) one after another, it is not necessary to
create a new team directory for each project/phase.</p>

<p>If the members of your team are predominately using the Microsoft
Windows operating system, the use of a UNC path is strongly
recommended.  That is, you would enter the directory path as
<tt>\\serverName\path\to\directory</tt> instead of
<tt>T:\path\to\directory</tt>.</p>
