<H1>Using the time log editor</H1>

<P>You can use the time log editor to correct mistakes you might make when 
timing your activities.</P>

<p><img src="../../Images/TimeLogEditor.jpg"></p>

<h3>Project hierarchy</h3>
<P>The left pane shows the current project hierarchy.  Picking various 
branches on the hierarchy will limit the time entries displayed to just those 
on the branch chosen.</P>

<h3>Date filter</h3>
<P>The two entries on the top labeled filter provide a date filtering on the 
time entries display.  The format of the date entry depends upon Java 
localization settings, which can be overridden by an entry in the 
configuration file.</P>

<h3>Time entries</h3>
<P>To change data in the time entries, just pick on the element that you 
would like to change.  The elements in the time entries pane are editable.  
The "Logged To" column shows the process phase to which the time was logged.  
These entries should <em>NOT</em> be edited.  The editor will replace any 
changes with the original entries if they are accidentally changed.  The 
"Start T" column shows the start time for the activity.  The "Delta" column 
shows the length of time spent in the activity.  The "Int" column shows the 
amount of time that the given activity was interrupted.</P>

<h3>Control buttons</h3>
<P>The Add and Delete buttons allow the addition and deletion of time 
entries.</P>

<P>The Save and Revert buttons will save the changes or revert the entries to 
their previous values.</P>

<P>The Summarize button will collapse all time entries that were logged to 
the same process phase into one entry.  The Dashboard will create new entries 
each time that it starts recording time in a given process phase (i.e. when a 
process phase is left and then returned to again for more time measurement).  
This function will allow you to collaspe all the duplicates.</P>
