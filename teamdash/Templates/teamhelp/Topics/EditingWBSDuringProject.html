<h1>Editing the WBS After Project Launch</h1>

<p>The Work Breakdown Structure Editor is designed to make editing easy and
fast.  Since the launch requires you to create a large and complex plan in
a short period of time, this is a great help during a project launch.</p>

<p>Later in the project launch, individuals will perform a "Sync to WBS"
operation.  This builds a personal plan for each team member which reflects
their assignments in the team WBS.  As the project begins, they will refine
estimates and collect actual data against these WBS elements.</p>

<p>Throughout the project, the team can continue to make changes to the WBS.
Individuals then perform a "Sync to WBS" operation and receive these changes.
For example:</p>

<ul>

<li>The most common use of this is to create new tasks and assign them to
    individuals.  The next time the individual performs a "Sync to WBS"
    operation, the task will be added to their personal plan.</li>

<li>In addition, you can rename existing components or tasks in the WBS.
    The next time an individual performs a "Sync to WBS" operation, that
    task will be renamed in their personal plan too.</li>

<li>You can move tasks in the WBS using cut-and-paste.  The next time an
    affected individual performs a "Sync to WBS" operation, that task will
    be moved in their personal plan in the exact same manner.</li>

<li>Also, you can delete tasks from the WBS.  The next time an affected
    individual performs a "Sync to WBS" operation, the dashboard will offer
    to delete the task from their personal plan.  If they have collected
    actual data against the task, the dashboard will not delete it (because
    you don't want actual data to be deleted) - instead, it will offer to
    mark it complete.</li>

<li>Of course, you can also reassign tasks from one individual to another.
    When the affected individuals "Sync", the task will be
    deleted/completed from one personal plan and added to the other.</li>

</ul>

<p>This is a very powerful set of features.  But with power comes
responsibility!  Once people have started collecting data, you should no
longer perform heavy-handed edits to the WBS, because the exact sequence of
edits will be applied to personal plans with a literal interpretation.<p>

<h2>Common Mistakes</h2>

<p>Some examples may make this clear.  Here are examples of accidental
changes that people could make without realizing the consequences.  <b>(Do
not follow these examples!)</b></p>

Existing tasks in the plan represent real plan entities.  If no one has

Create a brand new component in the WBS called Component X.  If this component

<h2>Understanding</h2>

<p>The bottom line is this: during a launch, when the team plan exists only in
the WBS, you can feel free to make massive changes.  But once the project has
started, you should slow down and be mindful of the edits you make.</p>

<p>Understanding is the key to using this successfully.  It is helpful to know
that each node in the WBS has an internal ID number that acts as a unique
identifier.  The number is assigned when the node is created.  The number does
not change when the node is renamed, or when it is moved using cut-and-paste.
When you perform sync operations, the sync logic matches nodes in the WBS and
nodes in the personal plan using these internal ID numbers; it does not match
nodes by name. (Otherwise, how could the sync logic ever carry out your rename
operations for you?)  So a series of edits that destroys WBS items and creates
new ones with the same names will not fool the sync logic - it will carry out
the same destructive changes verbatim.</p>

<p>The WBS is designed to be edited, and the "Sync" functionality stands ready
to apply your changes to the personal plans.  Do not be afraid of using them!
Just pay attention to what you're doing when you insert, delete, move, and
rename WBS items.</p>


<h2>Subdividing Tasks</h2>

<p>In fact, once you understand how the WBS and the Sync operations work
together, you can use these wisely to your advantage.  Here is an example.
Suppose that during the launch, you created a very large task called "Task A".
Very little was known about this task during the launch, so the team was
unable to break it down any farther.  Instead, they just put a large number of
hours directly on Task A.  After the project gets underway, the individual
working on Task A spends some time researching the task.  This gives them the
insight they need to break the task down further, into parts 1 through 5.  The
individual might open the WBS and carefully make the following changes:</p>

<ul>

<li>Find "Task A" in the WBS, and highlight its row.</li>

<li>Press the Insert key to insert a new row before the existing Task A.</li>

<li>Call the new row "Task A".</li>

<li>Now, rename the original "Task A" to "Research", and indent it one level
    so it appears underneath the newly created parent task.</li>

<li>Change the time estimate of the "Research" task to reflect the amount of
    time that has been spent so far in research.</li>

<li>Create five new rows after the "Research" task, all as children of the
    newly created "Task A" parent node.  Give these new subtasks names that
    reflect their meaning.</li>

<li>Enter time estimates for the new subtasks, based on the work that came out
    of the research effort.</li>

</ul>

<p>At the next sync, this sequence of edits will be applied to the personal
plan.  In particular, a new "Task A" parent task will be created; the existing
task in the personal plan will be renamed to "Research" and will be placed
under the new parent task; all existing time log entries will move along with
it.  Finally, new subtasks will be created to reflect the work that remains.
Once the sync is done, the individual will be able to mark "Research" complete
and earn value for the work done so far.</p>

<p>This general model could be used for any large task that needs to be broken
down further.  But to avoid confusion, it is only recommended when a single
individual is assigned to the task.</p>

<p>If this example confuses you, don't worry; you could take a simpler
approach.  During the launch, create Task A and immediately create two
subtasks: "Research" and "Execution".  Guess how much work will be required to
do the research, then put the remaining block of time on the Execution task.
Once the individual finishes their research phase, they can replace the
"Execution" placeholder with several subtasks that reflect the refined work
plan.</p>
