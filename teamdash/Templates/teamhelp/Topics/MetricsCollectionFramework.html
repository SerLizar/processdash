<h1>Defining a Metrics Collection Framework (Process Mentor)</h1>

<p>When implementing any metrics program, an organization must decide
upon a well-defined set of process metrics that they will
collect. Without precisely-defined metrics, data collected by
individuals cannot meaningfully be consolidated and analyzed at the
team level.</p>

<p>For high-maturity processes inspired by PSP<sup> (SM)</sup> and
TSP<sup> (SM)</sup>, these definitions include:</p>

<ul>

<li>The size metrics that will be used estimate and measure product
size</li>

<li>The process phases that will be used to characterize defect
injection and removal</li>

</ul>


<p>Choosing a particular set of size metrics and process phases will
result in a unique <b>metrics collection framework</b>, which can be
used in the planning and execution of a team project.</p>

<p>However, most people (even individuals with years of process
improvement experience) underestimate the complexity involved in
defining a good metrics collection framework. A good metrics
collection framework will allow an organization to grow and improve
their process without invalidating the wealth of historical data they
have collected.</p>

<p>The following mistakes are common when creating a new high-maturity
metrics collection framework:</p>

<ul>

<li>Making the phases or size metrics too specific, such that slight
changes in the organizational process make the metrics no longer
apply.</li>

<li>Making the phases or size metrics too granular, such that the
burden of collecting actual data becomes overwhelming for individuals.</li>

</ul>


<p>For convenience, two ready-made team metrics collection frameworks are
available for use with the Process Dashboard.  The first and most common
option is the TSP<sup>(SM)</sup> module (distributed by Tuma Solutions
under a permission statement from Carnegie Mellon University).  This module
can be downloaded from <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.processdash.com/download">http://www.processdash.com/</a> -
just look for the download that contains PSP<sup>(SM)</sup> and
TSP<sup>(SM)</sup> materials.  You will be required to complete a Carnegie
Mellon University survey and agree to their terms of use.</p>


<p>For organizations that prefer an open source alternative, a second
metrics collection framework is also provided.  This framework is based
upon MIL-STD-498, a United States military standard created to
&quot;establish uniform requirements for software development and
documentation.&quot; MIL-STD-498 was chosen as the basis for this
open-source framework because:</p>

<ul>

<li>Its extensive use on military contracts has made it the
inspiration behind many other software process definitions, and</li>

<li>The standard document itself is freely available, and unencumbered
by copyright or licensing restrictions (making open source adaptations
possible).</li>

</ul>


<p>Teams are strongly encouraged to use one of these frameworks if it meets
their needs. However, the Process Dashboard can support custom metrics
collection frameworks for organizations that need this functionality (for
example, teams that do not write software).  An editor and generator for
custom metrics frameworks is available at:</p>
