<H1>Running the Dashboard</H1>

<P>Both the PSP and the TSP require the collection and analysis of metrics at 
a <i>very</i> fine-grained level. Once data are collected at this level, 
statistical analyses of the data permit remarkable planning, tracking, 
prediction, and control of software products and projects.</p>

<p>These metrics collection and analysis processes, however, are not trivial. 
In any real-world project, tool support for the PSP and TSP become important 
considerations. Although studies have demonstrated that people can maintain 
their productivity when using the PSP without tool support, the "frustration 
factor" inherent with such an approach tries the patience of all but the most 
disciplined engineers, making PSP behaviors difficult to sustain.</p>

<P>The Process Dashboard was designed to facilitate a solution to this 
problem.  When using the dashboard, the metrics required by the PSP can be 
measured quickly, easily, and accurately.</p>
