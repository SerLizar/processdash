Errors.Cannot_Open.Title=Could not Open Project Files
Errors.Cannot_Open.Server_FMT=\
    The Work Breakdown Structure Editor attempted to read\n\
    project data from the following location:\n\
    \        {0}\n\
    Unfortunately, this server could not be contacted.  Make\n\
    certain you are connected to the network and try again.
Errors.Cannot_Open.Dir_FMT=\
    The Work Breakdown Structure Editor attempted to open\n\
    project data located in:\n\
    \        {0}\n\
    Unfortunately, this file/directory could not be found.\n\
    You may need to map a network drive to edit this data.
Errors.Cannot_Open.Zip_FMT=\

    WBS data.
Errors.Cannot_Open.Lock_FMT=\
    The Work Breakdown Structure Editor encountered an\n\
    unexpected error during startup: another process on\n\
    this computer seems to be locking the WBS data for\n\
    this project.  To prevent data corruption, this program\n\
    must exit.\n\
    \ \n\

    receive this message, restarting your computer may\n\
    be necessary.


Errors.Cannot_Save.Title=Unable to Save

    The Work Breakdown Structure Editor encountered an unexpected\n\
    error and was unable to save data.  Please doublecheck your\n\
    network connection.  Then, try saving again.
Errors.Cannot_Save.Dir_FMT=\
    The Work Breakdown Structure Editor encountered an unexpected error\n\
    and was unable to save data. This problem might have been caused by\n\
    poor network connectivity, or by read-only file permissions. Please\n\
    check to ensure that you can write to the following location:\n\
    \        {0}
Errors.Cannot_Save.Zip_FMT=${Errors.Cannot_Save.Dir_FMT}

    The WBS Editor has created a crash file containing information\n\
    about the state of the application and the data you were trying\n\
    to save when this error occurred. If possible, please consider\n\
    sending this file to the Process Dashboard development team:\n\
    \        {0}
Errors.Cannot_Save.Save_Advice=\
    If you shut down the Work Breakdown Structure Editor without\n\
    resolving this problem, any changes you have made will be lost.\n\
    To avoid losing your changes, you may wish to choose "Save a Copy"\n\
    from the "File" menu.

Errors.Cannot_Refresh.Title=Unable to Refresh Data
Errors.Cannot_Refresh.Server_FMT=\
    The Work Breakdown Structure Editor encountered an unexpected\n\
    error and was unable to refresh your view with changes made by\n\
    other individuals. Please doublecheck your network connection\n\
    and try refreshing again.
Errors.Cannot_Refresh.Dir_FMT=\
    The Work Breakdown Structure Editor encountered an unexpected\n\
    error and was unable to refresh your view with changes made by\n\
    other individuals. This problem might have been caused by poor\n\
    network connectivity, or by read-only file permissions. Please\n\
    check to ensure that you can access the following location:\n\
    \        {0}
Errors.Cannot_Refresh.Internal_Error=\
    The Work Breakdown Structure Editor encountered an unexpected\n\

    made by other individuals. Please contact the Process Dashboard\n\
    development team and pass along the following error information:
Errors.Cannot_Refresh.Internal_Error_File_FMT=\ \n\
    The WBS Editor has created a crash file containing information\n\
    about the state of the application and the data it was trying\n\
    to load when this error occurred. If possible, please consider\n\
    sending this file to the Process Dashboard development team:\n\
    \        {0}

Errors.Lost_Lock.Title=Network Connectivity Problems
Errors.Lost_Lock.Message=\
    Although you opened the work breakdown structure in read-write\n\
    mode, your connection to the network was broken, and your lock\n\
    on the WBS was lost.  In the meantime, another individual has\n\
    opened the work breakdown structure for editing, so your lock\n\
    could not be reclaimed.\n\
    \ \n\
    As a result, you will no longer be able to save changes to the\n\
    work breakdown structure.  You are strongly encouraged to close\n\
    and reopen the work breakdown structure editor.
Errors.Lost_Lock.Save_Advice=\
    To avoid losing your changes, you may wish to choose "Save a Copy"\n\
    from the "File" menu.

Errors.Open_Read_Only.Title=Open Project in Read-Only Mode
Errors.Open_Read_Only.Prompt=\
    Would you like to open the project anyway, in read-only mode?

Errors.Concurrent_Use.Message_FMT=\
    The Work Breakdown Structure for this project is currently\n\
    locked for editing by {0}.
Errors.Concurrent_Use.Anonymous_User=someone on another machine

Errors.Read_Only_Files.Message_FMT=\
    The Work Breakdown Structure Editor stores data for this project\n\
    into XML files located at:\n\
    \        {0}\n\
    \ \n\
    Unfortunately, the current filesystem permissions do not allow\n\
    you to modify those files.

Errors.Cannot_Create_Lock.Message_FMT=\
    The Work Breakdown Structure Editor stores data for this project\n\
    into XML files located at:\n\
    \        {0}\n\
    \ \n\
    The WBS Editor attempted to lock those files for writing, but the\n\
    operating system was unable to secure a write lock.  This is an\n\
    unusual situation, possibly caused by the current configuration of\n\
    the remote network directory.

Recommend_Read_Only.Title=Open Read-Only?
Recommend_Read_Only.Option_Read_Write=Open in read-write mode
Recommend_Read_Only.Option_Read_Only=Open in read-only mode
Recommend_Read_Only.Simultaneous_Prompt=\
    Would you like to open the WBS in read-only mode?\n\
    This is recommended if you only want to view the\n\
    data, and do not intend to make any changes.
Recommend_Read_Only.Exclusive_Prompt=\
    The Work Breakdown Structure is shared by the\n\
    entire team. If you only intend to view data\n\
    (not modify anything), you should open the WBS\n\
    in read-only mode, so others can make changes.\n\
    Which would you like to do?

Project_Closed.Title=Project / Iteration Closed
Project_Closed.Message=\
    This project / iteration has been marked "closed," and the\n\
    incomplete / in-progress work was copied to a new work\n\
    breakdown structure.\n\
    \ \n\
    You can still save changes to this WBS to perform simple\n\
    cleanups of completed tasks, and to label or categorize\n\
    items in support of postmortem data analysis. \n\
    \ \n\
    However, you should not create new tasks in this WBS or\n\
    assign tasks to individuals, because new tasks will not\n\
    be synchronized down into the personal plans of team\n\
    members.  Most ongoing changes should be made in the\n\
    WBS for the new project / iteration.

File_Replace.Confirm.Message=\
    You have requested to replace the planned data in this Work Breakdown\n\

    \ \n\
    \ \u2022 If your team has created several alternative plans during\n\

    \    wish to apply your offline changes, and no one else has altered\n\
    \    the real project WBS in the meantime\n\
    \ \n\
    When you perform a "replace data" operation, all of the data in the\n\
    current plan will be discarded and replaced with the data from the\n\
    file you specify.  Please ensure that this is your intent.\n\

PlanWatcher.Help.Title=Personal Editing Optimized Mode
PlanWatcher.Help.Explanation=\
    When you open the Work Breakdown Structure Editor\n\
    from your personal dashboard, the WBS will enter\n\
    "personal editing optimized mode" by default.  This\n\
    mode is designed to make it easier for you to alter\n\
    your personal plan.  For example, when you create a\n\
    new task, it will automatically be assigned to you.\n\
    \ \n\
    In addition, the WBS Editor will display a warning\n\
    if you make a change that affects a coworker's plan.\n\
    By heeding these warnings, you can make changes to\n\
    your plan with confidence, knowing that you won't\n\
    accidentally alter someone else's plan.\n\
    \ \n\
    "Personal editing optimized mode" can be very useful.\n\
    But there may be times that you wish to edit the full\n\
    team plan, including the plans of your team members.\n\
    Just open the "Team" menu and uncheck the box\n\
    labeled, "Optimizing Editing Operations for..."  This will\n\
    disable personal editing optimized mode.
