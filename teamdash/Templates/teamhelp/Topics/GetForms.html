<h1>Create or Obtain Forms and Reports for Project Use</h1>

<p>The Team Project Plan Summary forms in the Process Dashboard are
completely customizable. If you have just installed the Process
Dashboard and created a new Team Dashboard instance, the project plan
summary forms will initially be empty. For more information about this
feature, and an explanation of why the forms are initially empty, see
the <a href="FormsReports.html">Creating / Customizing Process Forms and
Reports</a> help topic.</p>

<p>During your launch (in particular, during Meetings 5 and 6), you
will need access to certain metrics data. As a result, you should take
a moment before the project launch begins to open your team project
plan summary, and ensure that it meets your planning needs. If the
summary form contains only an earned value report, you should take one
of the following actions:</p>

<ul>

<li style='margin-top:6.0pt'>Contact your organizational process
mentor to determine whether they have already created plan summary
forms for team use. If so, you can reuse those forms easily. Just
copy the<tt> cms </tt>subdirectory provided by your organizational
process mentor into the directory where your team configuration data
is stored. See the <a href="FormsReports.html#cm">Configuration
Management of Custom Forms</a> help topic for more information.</li>

<li style='margin-top:6.0pt'>Alternatively, you may build your own
customized project plan summary forms by clicking on the icon in the
top-right corner of the page (<img border=0 width=14 height=14
src="../Images/icon-cms-edit.gif">). If you use this approach, keep
in mind that all team and master projects in your Team Dashboard
instance share the same copy of this form.</li>

</ul>
