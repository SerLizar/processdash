<H1>Using Multiple "To Date" Data Sets</H1>

<PRE>paragraph stating why you would want multiple "To Date"
data sets. mention reasons like:
* segregating data from work in different programming
  languages
* rolling up data from all the subprojects that make up a
  given project
</PRE>

<H2>Creating Multiple "To Date" Data Sets</H2>

<p>Extra "To Date" data sets are created in much the same way you would 
create a new project.  To create additional "To Date" data sets,
<ol>
<li>Open the Hierarchy Editor.
<li>Choose a location on your hierarchy where you would like to create the
    additional data set.
<li>From the "Edit" menu, choose "Add Template", then "Rollup PSP Data".
<li>A node will appear in your hierarchy for the "To Date" data set. Give it
    a descriptive name, like "Java Projects" or "Project Foobar".
<li>From the "File" menu, choose "Save".
</ol>

Note - there is always a "default" rollup, defined automatically by
the dashboard, which is called "/To Date/PSP/All".  This rollup will
not appear in your hierarchy, but its data will be available for use
by projects in your hierarchy.

<H2>Customizing "To Date" Data Sets</H2>

<p>When you first create a new "To Date" data set, it will (by
default) be rolling up data from all completed PSP projects.
Therefore, the first thing you'll probably want to do is customize the
filter which is used to generate the list of projects that it will
roll up data from.  To do this:
<ol>
<li>Use the hierarchy buttons to navigate to the "To Date" data set.
<li>Click the drop-down button to the right of the script button, and
    choose "Edit Data Rollup Filter".
<li>A form will appear in your web browser to let you edit the expression
    which is used to filter the project list.  To make life easier, some
    common filter criteria are displayed:<ul>
    <li>Only rollup projects completed after a certain date
    <li>Only rollup projects written with a certain language
    <li>Only rollup projects with certain keywords
    <li>Only rollup projects whose hierarchy path starts with a
        certain string
    </ul>
<li>You can check the appropriate boxes, and edit the details for each
    criteria.  When you're done, click the "Filter!" button. This button 
    will compute the corresponding filter expression, and put it in the
    box below.  This will also cause the "list of included projects" to
    recalculate, showing you all the projects in your hierarchy that meet
    the criteria.

<li>If you feel comfortable with the data expression syntax, you can
    edit the filter expression directly.  After you make changes to
    the expression, you'll have to move the cursor out of the text
    area (by hitting TAB or by clicking somewhere on the HTML page
    background) for the included project list to recalculate.<BR>
    <B>TIP:</B> If the included project list is empty and you don't
    think it should be, you may have a syntax error in your filter
    expression.  A syntax error in your expression will essentially be
    treated the same as the expression "false".  Note, however, that
    an empty included project list does not automatically mean your
    filter expression syntax is bad - it may be a valid expression, and
    there just might not be any projects that meet the criteria.
</ol>
    
<H2>Viewing Rolled Up Data</H2>    

<PRE>
* navigate to a data rollup
* click the script button
* the Data Analysis center will appear, showing the data
  from the projects in the rollup.
</PRE>

<H2>Using Alternate "To Date" Data Sets</H2>

<p>Once you have created an additional data rollup set, you will
notice that all of your PSP project plan summaries will contain an
extra drop-down list.  This drop down list is located in the "Project
Settings" section of the plan summary form.  The drop-down list is
labeled "Base 'To Date' PSP data on:", and the drop down list will
contain all the PSP data rollup objects you have defined, plus the
extra "default" rollup, which is called "/To Date/PSP/All".  Choosing
a different rollup from this list will cause all this project to
use that rollup for calculating data in the "Plan" and "To Date" columns.

<p><B>TIP:</B> remember that data in the plan column freezes when
planning is marked complete, and data in the "To Date" columns freezes
when the project is marked complete.  Therefore, if Planning and/or
the entire project is marked complete when you alter the drop-down,
the data in the "Plan" and "To Date" columns will not recalculate.
