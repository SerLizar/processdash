To build the PSP Dashboard, you will need:

   * the Sun JDK, version 1.4.  Set the environment variable
     JAVA_HOME to the path to your JDK installation directory.

   * ant, available from http://ant.apache.org/

   * (optional) to compile in support for context-sensitive help, you
     must install JavaHelp from Sun.  Set the environment variable
     JAVAHELP_HOME to point to the javahelp installation directory.

Then simply run "ant" on the file "build.xml" in this directory.
