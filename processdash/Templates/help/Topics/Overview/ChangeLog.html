<h2>Features new in version 1.7</h2>

<ul>

 <li>The Process Dashboard now integrates with a wide variety of web
   browsers on all platforms.  In particular, Unix/Linux users no
   longer need to use an older version of Netscape to view dashboard
   forms.</li>

 <li>It is now possible to export a snapshot of the Data Analysis 
   center for your personal data.</li>  

 <li>The Data Analysis center has been enhanced to support custom
   processes.  Users who define a custom process will see customized
   versions of Report 3, 4, and 5 for their process.</li>

 <li>New wizards for importing and exporting data can assist with
   the rollup of team project metrics.</li>

 <li>The Process Dashboard now contains extensive support for
   internationalization.  A Localization Tool is provided to help
   users translate dashboard messages into their native language, and
   share those translations with other users.</li>

</ul>


<h2>Features new in version 1.6</h2>

<ul>

 <li>The dashboard contains several innovative enhancements to earned
   value functionality:<ul>

   <li>The earned value tool in the dashboard can now calculate
     estimated prediction intervals for forecast completion date and
     forecast cost.  These intervals compare your planned progress to
     your actual progress using numerical methods and approximate
     pivotal statistics, computing a range of dates within which your
     project is likely to finish.  The dashboard can calculate these
     ranges both for individual earned value schedules and for
     rolled-up team schedules.</li>

   <li>Traditional PSP earned value planning addresses only
     &quot;direct time,&quot; omitting time spent on recurring
     activities (such as weekly meetings) and ongoing activities (such
     as communicating with customers and management, or participating
     on committees).  Unfortunately, &quot;direct time&quot; is an
     unfamiliar metric for many organizations, which are accustomed to
     tracking &quot;project time&quot; instead. As a result, senior
     managers in some organizations take issue with earned value plans
     that reflect only 15-20 direct hours per week.<br>

     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help development teams
     avoid this potential misunderstanding, the dashboard now provides
     an innovative new feature: &quot;level of effort&quot; tasks can
     be added to earned value task lists.  Although these tasks don't
     affect the earned value calculations, they do allow you to create
     a schedule that accounts for all of your &quot;project time&quot;
     - and this can help when you present plans to management for
     approval.  To add &quot;level of effort&quot; tasks to an earned
     value plan, just enter percentages for these tasks in the
     &quot;planned time&quot; column instead of durations.  (Planned
     direct time for the periods in the schedule is then calculated
     automatically by reducing the planned total time by the
     appropriate percentage.)  To help you enhance the accuracy of
     future estimates, &quot;actual time&quot; for &quot;level of
     effort&quot; tasks is also displayed as a percentage.</li>

   <li>Earned value task lists in the dashboard have always been
     hierarchically organized.  When the list of tasks for a
     particular project differs from the structure of your dashboard
     hierarchy, new features in the earned value tool allow you to
     &quot;prune&quot; and reorder tasks to better describe the work
     that needs to be done.</li>

   <li>At times in the middle of a project, you may decide that you
     wish to &quot;re-plan&quot; the remaining tasks and start with a
     fresh earned value schedule.  The dashboard now makes this
     simple: just change the starting date on your earned value
     schedule to the current date.  All work performed before the
     starting date of the schedule will be factored out of earned
     value calculations automatically.</li>

 </ul></li>

 <li>The &quot;Data Analysis&quot; center now allows you to generate
   custom charts and reports, simply by selecting options from
   drop-down lists.  The data in these custom charts and reports can
   also be exported to Excel for further custom analysis.</li>

 <li>The time log now includes a column for the entry of optional
   comments.</li>

 <li>It is now possible to create and edit custom defect type
   standards.</li>

</ul>


<h2>Features new in version 1.5 (released October 3, 2002)</h2>
<ul>
 <li>The dashboard is now compatible with version 1.4 and higher of
   the Java Runtime Environment.</li>

 <li>The dashboard now contains support for Netscape 6 and higher on
   Windows platforms, and is also compatible with the Sun Java Plug-in
   in Internet Explorer.</li>

 <li>The task and schedule planning tool now contains built-in support
   for collaboration! You can share your schedules with your
   co-workers, your manager, and/or your customer, and keep them
   up-to-date on your progress.  If you are working on a project with
   other people, you can roll up your individual schedules to create
   an earned value schedule for the project.</li>

 <li>The task and schedule planning tool helps you to avoid several
   common planning mistakes.</li>

 <li>The hierarchy editor now includes a toolbar to facilitate the
  editing of your work breakdown structure.</li>

 <li>Numerous user interface enhancements make the hierarchy editor,
   the time log editor, and the defect log editor easier to use.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Features new in version 1.4 (released February 22, 2002)</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Creating custom processes has never been easier - now you can create  
   your own process definitions for use with the dashboard by writing a simple 
   XML file.</li>

 <li>Task and schedule features help you to track your work using earned 
   value, and calculate forecasts for cost and schedule.</li>

 <li>New "data rollup" templates allow you to roll-up data from
   multiple projects. This feature makes it possible to:
  <ul>
   <li>Roll up psp data to the project level.</li>
   <li>Create multiple subsets of "To Date" data (for example, representing 
      different programming languages). The "To Date" data mechanism now 
      allows you to select, for each project, which subset should be used for 
      automatic calculations.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li>External documents are now integrated into the process scripts - click 
   on hyperlinks for documents like the PIP form, the Issue Tracking Log, 
   etc. and the appropriate document will be opened for the project you're 
   working on.</li>

 <li>A new "PROBE Wizard" simplifies the PROBE process, and provides advice 
   on which PROBE method is most appropriate.</li>

 <li>You can now export forms (like the Project Plan Summary or the Size 
   Estimating Template) to Excel for additional, custom analysis. If you want 
   to show your data to others, or save copies of forms for project 
   documentation, you can also export these forms to static HTML 
   documents.</li>

 <li>You can now "unlock" the read-only data on forms if you want to override 
   any of the calculations that the dashboard automatically performs for 
   you.</li>

 <li>The hierarchy editor now allows you to move nodes/projects. Cut and paste 
   operations make it possible to reorganize your work breakdown structure.</li>

 <li>The drop-down list on the script button now displays choices like 
   "Project Plan Summary" instead of listing the names of process phases. In 
   addition, a "script browser" makes it easy to open a script/form for any 
   project in your hierarchy without needing to navigate to that project 
   first.</li>

 <li>Checkmarks in the hierarchy menus make it easy to see which phases / 
   projects have been marked complete.</li>

 <li>The "pspdiff" program (which calculates added / deleted / modified 
   physical LOC counts) is now incorporated into the dashboard.</li>

 <li>A major overhaul of the internal data calculation engine allows the 
   dashboard to recalculate data up to 10 times faster.</li>

 <li>If you insert "Design Review" or "Code Review" phases into a PSP0 - 
   PSP1.1 project, these phases will automatically appear on the project plan 
   summary and in the process scripts.</li>

 <li>The text "ERROR" in the dashboard forms has been changed to "#VALUE!" or 
   "#DIV/0!" to behave more like Excel.</li>

 <li>An entry to enter the Total LOC was added to the Size Estimating 
   Template screen.  This only makes sense since you have to enter nearly all 
   other actual LOC measures on this form.</li>

 <li>Help was implemented via a sub menu.  Other items on the Help sub menu 
   allow you to submit bug reports online and navigate to the user online 
   help forum.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features new in version 1.3.1 (released August 14, 2001)</h2>

<ul>
 <li>Version 1.3.1 was released to address a high-priority bug present in 
   version 1.3.  No significant new features were added to 1.3 for this 
   release.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features new in version 1.3 (released July 16, 2001)</h2>

<ul>
 <li>The dashboard now includes greatly enhanced online help! Improved help 
   has been the #1 requested feature by you, the user community. We are 
   therefore pleased to offer indexed, searchable online help with ten times 
   the content of version 1.2.</li>

 <li>The dashboard now includes a "Generic" process.  When you use the 
   generic process to perform a task, it allows you to:
  <ul>
   <li>Choose any list of phases, with custom names</li>
   <li>Decide whether or not it makes sense to track defects for the task</li>
   <li>Decide whether or not it makes sense to measure size for the task, and 
      choose a custom unit of size measurement.</li>
  </ul>

  The dashboard then provides a customized Project Plan Summary Form for your 
   custom process.</li>

 <li>The dashboard now contains a mechanism for freezing baselined data. When 
   you mark the planning phase of a project complete, all the data in the 
   "Plan" column of the Project Plan Summary form will freeze and stop 
   recalculating. Similarly, when you mark the project complete, all the data 
   in the "To Date" column will freeze and stop recalculating. This makes it 
   possible to view the report again in the future without having the numbers 
   changing in the report.</li>

 <li>The dashboard can now notify you when updates are released, either to 
   the dashboard itself or to the add-on process sets you have installed.</li>

 <li>The PROBE tool now contains a drop-down box for quickly exploring PROBE 
   methods A, B, and C.</li>

 <li>The Play/Pause button now has a drop-down menu for quickly jumping to a 
   task where you have recently logged time. If you often bounce back and 
   forth between tasks for different projects, this feature makes your life 
   easier.</li>

 <li>Numerous bug fixes make the Time Log Editor more robust.</li>

 <li>The Time Log Editor now makes it easy to quickly filter your view of the 
   time log to "Today", "This Week", or "This Month". Forward and backward 
   buttons let you scroll to look at different time periods.</li>

 <li>The play/pause button and the hierarchy menus now provide audible 
   feedback to help you keep track of whether the dashboard is timing or 
   paused.</li>

 <li>The previous version of the dashboard would only write entries to the 
   time log when you changed phases; now, the time log is updated 
   continually. The data in your time log and your project plan summary forms 
   is never more than a minute old.</li>

 <li>When you find yourself fixing several defects at once (which can happen 
   often due to "fix defects" and "related defects"), the dashboard provides 
   better assistance.  It automatically ensures that only one defect timer is 
   running at a time, and maintains a stack of "interrupted" defects.</li>

 <li>The Defect Log Editor now allows defects to be deleted. It also supports 
   quick filtering to see the defects which were injected or removed in a 
   given phase.</li>

 <li>Timer icons have been placed on the HTML forms to allow navigation among 
   the phases of development without having to reach all the way up to the 
   hierarchy menus.</li>

 <li>A method was added that will allow driving of the dashboard by another 
   program.  This will allow IDE developers to add support for the 
   dashboard from within their programming environments.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features new in version 1.2 (released April 20, 2001)</h2>

<ul>
 <li>The dashboard now includes support for ALL the standard PSP processes 
   (PSP0, PSP0.1, PSP1.0, PSP1.1, PSP2.0, PSP2.1, and PSP3.0). All of the 
   online PSP process scripts and forms have been edited to conform as 
   closely as possible to the originals in the PSP book.</li>

 <li>The dashboard now displays charts and reports! Choose the "Data Analysis" 
   option on the "C" menu, and dozens of standard charts and reports are 
   available (including ALL the tables required by reports R3, R4, and R5, 
   and ALL the charts currently drawn by the SEI's "Student Workbook" Excel 
   spreadsheet). With a single click, export data to Excel for further 
   analysis.</li>

 <li>The PROBE tool is now simpler to use. Previously, it would allow you to 
   explore the correlation between any two data items; unfortunately, this 
   made it cumbersome for everyday use. Now, by default, it only displays the 
   data items traditionally used by the PSP PROBE methodology.</li>

 <li>The PSP0 - PSP1.1 processes now support optional "Design Review" and 
   "Code Review" phases.</li>

 <li>Errors in several calculations have been corrected. Also, the "To Date" 
   data calculations have been completely revamped and are now working 
   properly.</li>

 <li>Data calculation efficiency has been improved.</li>

 <li>With the addition of the standard PSP processes, the SCR/DCR processes 
   are no longer shipped with the dashboard. If are a current dashboard user, 
   and you have been using the SCR/DCR processes, your existing SCR/DCR 
   projects WILL still work. If you wish to continue creating projects that 
   use the SCR/DCR processes in the future, please download the SCR/DCR 
   process separately.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features new in version 1.1 (released February 9, 2001)</h2>

<ul>
 <li>Version 1.1 contained enhancements that made the tool significantly 
   easier to install.</li>
</ul>
