<H1>Entering defects</H1>

<P>We all make mistakes.  Dealing with those mistakes in a constructive way 
so that we can learn from them is a lot of what process improvement is all
about.</P>

<P>Entering defects in the dashboard is as easy as choosing the defect button.</P>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/PointToDefectButton.png"></p>

<P>When the defect button is chosen, the defect dialog pops up so that you 
can enter information about the defect that you have discovered.</P>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/EnterDefect.png"></p>

<P>In this dialog box, you enter all the data necessary to describe the 
defect.  Each feature of the dialog box is detailed below.</P>

<h2>Defect type</h2>
<P>The defect type pulldown allows you to choose the type of defect.  The 
choices are determined by the defect type standard that is in effect for
the currently selected project.  You can create new defect type standards,
and configure the defect type standards that should be used for various
projects;  see the <a href="UsingDefectLogEditor.html">defect editor</a>
help topic for more information.</P>

<a name="fixDefects"></a><h2>"fix defects"</h2>
<P>The "Fix Defect" entry is where you can put the ID number of another 
defect if this is a "fix defect".  A fix defect is a defect that was 
injected while fixing another defect.  In order to determine the ID number of 
the other defect, you can pull up the defect editor by choosing "Defect Log" 
on the "C" menu.  One of the columns of information about each defect will 
show the ID number.  For more information about using the Defect Log see the 
<a href="UsingDefectLogEditor.html">Using the defect log editor</a> help 
topic.</P>

<P>The "new fix defect" button to the right of the ID entry provides another 
way to enter a fix defect.  Consider the following relatively common case.  
You are fixing a bug (so you already have the defect dialog open and it is 
timing your fix).  You edit your code and save the changes.  You compile and 
link to run a test to verify your fix.  Immediately you notice that your fix 
broke something else.  At this point, you can click the new fix defect button 
to get a second defect dialog (to enter this new defect).  This second dialog 
will have the ID number of the previous defect already entered in the ID 
entry blank.  You can now input data relating to this new fix defect. The 
following screenshot shows two defect dialogs open.  The second dialog (the 
one on top) is being used to enter a fix defect.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/QSTwoDefectDialogs.png"></p>

<p>This process works with defects that you edit from within the defect log 
editor as well.  See the section below on <a 
href="#fixingMultipleDefects">fixing multiple defects</a> for more discussion 
on having two defect dialogs open at once.</P> 


<h2>Phase injected and phase removed</h2>
<P>The defect injected and defect removed pulldowns allow selection of the 
phases in which the defect was injected and removed, respectively.  The 
dashboard will set both of these to what it thinks are appropriate choices 
given the current development phase, but that default choice can be 
overridden easily.</P>

<a name="timing"></a><h2>Timing the defect fix</h2>
<P>The defect dialog has its own built in timer independent of the main 
dashboard timer.  By default, when the dialog first appears, it starts timing 
the fix of the defect.  The fix time display will show the time passing.  The 
intent of this behavior is that most people will discover a defect, push the 
defect button on the dashboard and immediately start fixing the defect.  In 
this scenario, the dialog will immediately start timing the fix.  This 
behavior can be changed via an entry in the preferences editor.  Adding the 
following advanced setting will cause the defect dialog to appear without
starting the defect timer.</P>

<PRE>defectDialog.autostart=false</PRE>

<P>For more information about making this configuration change see the <a 
href="../AdvancedTopics/ConfigurationFile.html">advanced settings</a> help 
topic.</P>

<P>The timer start/stop button allows starting and stopping of the defect 
timer.  If you stop fixing the given defect but are not finished with the 
fix, you can press this button to stop the timer.</P>

<P>In any case, you can stop the timer and enter a specific time in the fix 
time display box.</P>

<h2>Entering a description</h2>
<P>The defect description pane is where you record a description of the defect.</P>

<a name="fixingMultipleDefects"></a><h2>Fixing multiple defects at a time</h2>

<P>If you have the need to fix more than one defect at one time, you can do 
so by simply pushing the defect button on the dashboard again to display 
another defect dialog.  When this happens, the timer on the first dialog will 
stop (if it was running) and the new defect dialog's timer will start 
recording time for the new defect.  This new defect will become the "current" 
defect.  When this new defect dialog is dismissed, the most previously opened 
defect dialog will become the current defect.  It will pop to the front and 
its timer will start up again (if it had been running previously).</P>

<P>In this way you can keep an arbitrary number of defect dialogs open at 
once.  If this is to be done, we recommend that you enter a description of 
the defect into the dialog box as soon as it is opened so that when it comes 
back to the front as the currently active defect, it will be clear what you 
were working on.</P>
