<H2>Why build a tool?</H2>

<P>Both the PSP and the TSP require the collection and analysis of metrics at a 
<I>very</I> fine-grained level. Further, TSP requires teams to roll-up 
individual metrics to produce team metrics. Once data are collected at this 
level, statistical analyses of the data permit remarkable planning, tracking, 
prediction, and control of software products and projects.</P>
<P>These metrics collection and analysis processes, however, are not trivial. In 
any real-world project, tool support for the PSP and TSP become important 
considerations. Although studies have demonstrated that people <U>can</U> 
maintain their productivity when using the PSP <I>without</I> tool support, the 
"frustration factor" inherent with such an approach tries the patience of all 
but the most disciplined engineers, making PSP behaviors difficult to 
sustain.</P>
<P>Ideally, PSP/TSP practitioners would like to have a support tool that:</P>

        <LI>Allows data at the personal level to be 
        collected quickly and easily, with minimal frustration. 
        <LI>Can be integrated with existing development 
        environments and project management tools. 
        <LI>Allows individuals to collaborate on the 
        execution of a process (even if they are geographically distributed). 
        <LI>Allows data at the individual level to be rolled 
        up to produce team-level or organizational-level metrics. 
        <LI>Protects the privacy of individuals, and 
        prevents unauthorized people from seeing or using their data. 
        <LI>Supports powerful analyses of data at the 
        individual, team, organizational, and enterprise levels, and allows 
        existing (external) applications to access the data (while still 
        maintaining the security mentioned above). 
        <LI>Supports arbitrary processes (including processes that have 
        yet to be written), and arbitrary new process 
tools.</LI></UL></TD></TR>

<P>This initiative aims to develop an open-source tool to meet all of these 
needs.</P>
