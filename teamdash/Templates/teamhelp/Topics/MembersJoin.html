<h1>Join Team Project (Team Members)</h1>

<p>Each team member must join the team project.</p>

<p>Before you can join the project, you must have successfully
installed the Process Dashboard. Start the Process Dashboard and leave
it running.</p>

<p>Your team leader will send you a special URL that you can use to
join the team project. Open that URL in a Web browser.</p>

<p>If you get an error message like &quot;This page cannot be
displayed&quot; when you attempt to visit this page, contact your team
leader and ask him or her to start the Team Dashboard, then click the
refresh button on your Web browser. If your team leader tells you that
the Team Dashboard <b><u>is</u></b> running and you still cannot view
the page, see the <a href="NetworkTroubleshooting.html">Troubleshooting
Network Connectivity</a> help topic.</p>


<p>The Team Project Setup Wizard will walk you through the steps
involved in joining the team project. Read each page carefully and
supply the information requested.</p>

<p>When the wizard finishes, you can close the browser window.</p>
