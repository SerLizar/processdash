<p>The PROBE process is thoroughly described in the PSP book
<i>A&nbsp;Discipline for Software Engineering</i>, but it can be
complicated to follow.  Even when the calculations are performed for you
(for example, by the <a href="UsingProbeTool.html">PROBE Tool</a>), there
are many cross-checks you must perform to verify the validity of the
estimates.  For individual who do not thoroughly understand the
calculations being performed, it is easy to make a mistake.</p>

<p>The PROBE Wizard recognizes and reduces this complexity by automating as
much of the process as possible.  The PROBE Wizard can be opened by
clicking on the link found on the 
<a href="UsingSizeEstimatingTemplate.html">Size Estimating Template</a>.</p>

<p>When the PROBE Wizard is activated, it starts with a welcoming screen that 
reminds you of the nature of estimating with the PROBE method.</p>

<h2>PROBE Wizard Step 1</h2>
<p>Step 1 in the PROBE method is to verify that the Estimated Object 
LOC number is accurate.  The Wizard shows you the number you have input on 
the Size Estimating Template and asks you to verify that this is indeed a 
good estimate.</p>

<h2>PROBE Wizard Step 2</h2>
<p>Step 2 is to verify your historical data.  The PROBE Wizard puts up a 
table of numbers that shows your estimations from previous PSP projects.</p>

<p><center><img src="../../Images/ProbeWizard2.png"></center></p>

<p>On this pane, you can exclude data points that you know to be "outliers" 
statistically.  By clicking on the checkboxes at the end of each row, you can 
exclude any data point that you know does not represent your normal work 
processes.  If you are not completely sure about the consequences of 
excluding outlier data, you should probably leave all of the boxes 
unchecked.</p>

<h2>PROBE Wizard Step 3</h2>
<p>Step 3 is to estimate the size of the new development effort.  The PROBE 
method (as implemented by the Process Dashboard) outlines 5 ways to estimate 
size:</p>

<p><table border=0 cellpadding=2 hspace=5>

 <tr valign="top"><td>A</td>
  <td>Estimate size based on a good correlation between previous Estimated 
   Object LOC data and Actual New and Changed LOC data. This method is the 
   most preferred method, but can only be used if you have sufficient data 
   that correlates well.</td>
 </tr>

 <tr valign="top"><td>B</td>
  <td>If Object LOC estimates do not correlate well enough to use method A, 
   PROBE suggests estimating size based on a good correlation between 
   previous Estimated New and Changed LOC data and Actual New and Changed LOC 
   data. Again, this method can only be used if you have sufficient data that 
   correlates well.</td>
 </tr>

 <tr valign="top"><td>C1</td>
  <td>If neither of the data pairings for methods A and B correlate, but you 
   do have Estimated Object LOC data, you can use that data to do the 
   estimate.  This method requires at least some Estimated Object LOC data be 
   recorded.</td>
 </tr>

 <tr valign="top"><td>C2</td>
  <td>If you do not have any Estimated Object LOC, but you do have Estimated 
   New and Changed LOC data, you can use that data to do the estimate.  This 
   method requires at least some Estimated New and Changed LOC data be 
   recorded.</td>

 <tr valign="top"><td>D</td>
  <td>If you have no historical data, method D just indicates that you should 
   use your best engineering judgement to make the estimate.</td></tr>
</table></p>

<p>The Wizard will present all of these possibilities to you in decreasing 
order of preference based on how well each method seems to track (or 
correlates) with your historical data.  You just have to choose the method 
you would like to follow by picking from a set of radio boxes.</p>

<p><center><img src="../../Images/ProbeWizard3.png"></center></p>

<p>The Wizard also has links to explanatory help windows that will pop up and 
give you more detail about the different types of calculations that it is 
doing to generate the different estimates.  These links are shown in <font 
color="blue">blue text</font>.</p>

<h2>PROBE Wizard Step 4</h2>
<p>Step 4 is very similar to step 3, except the estimation is for time 
instead of size.  The same basic set of methods is available, and the Wizard 
will offer each data estimate in decreasing order of preference.</p>

<p>The PROBE method (as implemented by the Process Dashboard) outlines 6 ways 
to estimate time:</p>

<p><table border=0 cellpadding=2 hspace=5>

 <tr valign="top"><td>A</td>
  <td>Estimate time based on a good correlation between previous Estimated 
   Object LOC data and Actual time data. This method is the most preferred 
   method, but can only be used if you have sufficient data that correlates 
   well.</td>
 </tr>

 <tr valign="top"><td>B</td>
  <td>If Object LOC estimates do not correlate well enough to use method A, 
   PROBE suggests estimating time based on a good correlation between 
   previous Estimated New and Changed LOC data and Actual time data. Again, 
   this method can only be used if you have sufficient data that correlates 
   well.</td>
 </tr>

 <tr valign="top"><td>C1</td>
  <td>If neither of the data pairings for methods A and B correlate, but you 
   do have Estimated Object LOC data, you can use that data to do the 
   estimate.  This method requires at least some Estimated Object LOC data be 
   recorded.</td>
 </tr>

 <tr valign="top"><td>C2</td>
  <td>If you do not have any Estimated Object LOC, but you do have Estimated 
   New and Changed LOC data, you can use that data to do the estimate.  This 
   method requires at least some Estimated New and Changed LOC data be 
   recorded.</td>

 <tr valign="top"><td>C3</td>
  <td>If you only have Actual Time and Size data, you can use that data to do 
   the estimate.</td>

 <tr valign="top"><td>D</td>
  <td>If you have no historical data, method D just indicates that you should 
   use your best engineering judgement to make the estimate.</td></tr>
</table></p>

<p>Unlike other wizards you may have used in the past, the PROBE Wizard 
updates the data in the dashboard whenever you click the Continue button to 
move onward (that is why there is no Cancel button on the Wizard).  If you 
make a mistake while using the Wizard, you'll have to use the Back button to 
go back and fix it, or make the change manually on the Size Estimating 
Template.  Of course, you can always just run the PROBE Wizard a second 
time.</p> 

<h2>PROBE Wizard Step 5</h2>

<p>At this point, you are finished making your estimates.  Step 5 encourages 
you to check the estimates to make sure that they make sense.</p>

<p><center><img src="../../Images/ProbeWizard5.png"></center></p>

<p>Clicking Finish dismisses the PROBE Wizard.</p>

<h2>A sanity check</h2>

<p>After you use various PROBE methods to independently generate your size 
estimate and your time estimate, it is always a good idea to "sanity check" 
those estimates to ensure that they are reasonable and in synch with each 
other.  The final screen of the PROBE Wizard helps with this task.  It uses 
your size and time estimates to calculate your planned productivity, and then 
compares this number with your historical productivity to date.  When your 
planned productivity is significantly different than your historical 
productivity, it is usually a warning flag indicating that either your size 
estimate or your time estimate (or possibly both) is incorrect.  When this 
occurs, the PROBE wizard strongly encourages you to reexamine your 
estimates.</p>

<p>If you rexamine your estimates and decide not to change them, you can 
simply close the PROBE Wizard (using the "X" in the window title bar). The 
estimates you chose for size and time will still appear on the Size 
Estimating Template.</p>
