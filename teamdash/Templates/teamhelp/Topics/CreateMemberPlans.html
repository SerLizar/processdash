<h1>Create Individual Team Member Plans</h1>
<b>(TSP Launch Meeting No. 6)</b>

<p>Once the team plan is created and balanced, you can copy the data
in this plan to create plans for each team member. For simplicity, it
is best to wait until the team is satisfied with the balanced plan
before proceeding to this step. The team leader should save the work
breakdown structure (using the Save option on the File menu of the
Work Breakdown Structure Editor), and then have each team member
perform the steps below. (If any project tasks were assigned to the
team leader, then the team leader should perform the steps below as
well.)</p>

<p>Before an individual can follow the instructions below, they must have
already <a href="Installing.html">installed the Process Dashboard</a> and
<a href="MembersJoin.html">joined the team project</a>. If a particular
team member has not yet performed these steps, they must accomplish them
first before they can follow the steps below.</p>

<h2>Doublecheck Personal Settings</h2>

<p>On your personal computer, start the Process Dashboard. Use the
hierarchy menus to navigate to the team project. Then click the
down-arrow to the right of the script button, and choose Edit Project
Parameters and Settings.</p>

<p>The Team Project Parameters and Settings page will appear in your
web browser.  Find the text field containing your initials.
Double-check to ensure that these initials match the ones assigned to
you during the previous team-planning meeting.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/indiv-settings-page.png"></p>

<p>If the initials do not match, you must take <i>one</i> of the
following corrective actions:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>Ask your team leader to change your initials in the team plan,
      using the Team Member List Editor, and resave the WBS.  Or</li>

  <li>Edit your initials in the blank provided.</li>

  </ul>

<h2><a name="syncWBS"></a>Synchronize Work Breakdown Structure</h2>

<p>After ensuring that your initials match, return to your main
dashboard window, click the down-arrow to the right of the script
button, and choose Sync Work Breakdown Structure.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/indiv-scripts-sync.png"></p>

<p>Then wait while the dashboard copies data from the team plan.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/indiv-sync-success.png"></p>

<p>If this is the first time you have synchronized and you see a
message, &quot;Your hierarchy is up to date - no changes were
necessary,&quot; then your initials most likely do not match the
initials in the team plan.  Return to the first step above, and follow
the instructions carefully.</p>


<h2><a name="schedule"></a>Review Planned Tasks and Schedule</h2>

<p>Return to your Process Dashboard window. From the script button
drop-down menu, choose Open Earned Value Task and Schedule. Your
personal schedule will be displayed.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/indiv-task-schedule.png"></p>

<p>The top half of this window shows a list of tasks assigned to
you. Review this list of tasks to ensure that it appears correct.</p>


<p>The bottom half of the window shows your personal schedule.  Each
row shows a particular week on the calendar.  The Planned Time (PT)
column shows the number of hours you might be able to spend on
productive project work each week.  Review this information to ensure
that it appears correct.  If any changes are necessary, make the
appropriate edits and click the Save button.  You can then close the
Task and Schedule window if you wish.</p>

<h2>Export Personal Data</h2>

<p><a name="export"></a>Finally, return to your Process Dashboard
window.  Click the down-arrow to the right of the script button, and
select the Export My Data Now option.</p>
