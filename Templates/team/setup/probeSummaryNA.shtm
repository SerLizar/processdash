<h2>Project Plan Summary - Unexpected Project/Task</h2>

<p>This Plan Summary form is designed to be used with team project workflows
that include a PROBE task.  Unfortunately, "<!--#echo PATH_TRANSLATED -->"
does not appear to be an applicable project/task, so this form cannot be
displayed.</p>

<p>If you recently renamed this project or task, please close this window and
reopen the Plan Summary from the script menu.</p>
