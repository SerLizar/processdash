<H1>Using the time log editor</H1>

<P>You can use the time log editor to correct mistakes you might make when 
timing your activities.</P>

<p><img src="../../Images/TimeLogEditor.png"></p>

<h2>Project hierarchy</h2>
<P>The left pane shows the current project hierarchy.  Selecting various 
branches on the hierarchy will limit the time entries displayed to just those 
on the branch chosen.</P>

<P>Next to the name of each hierarchy node, the dashboard displays the total
amount of time that has been logged against that node and all its children.
If you apply a date filter (see below), these times will recalculate based on
the filtered view of the time log.</P>

<h2>Date filter</h2>
<P>Above the split pane is a set of controls that provide date filtering on 
the time entries display.  Once the desired span of dates has been chosen, 
clicking the "Apply Filter" button will restrict the data shown to the range 
of dates specified.</p>

<P>The Apply Filter button has a pulldown control that provides for several 
common date filters.</p>

<p><img src="../../Images/ShowTimeLogFilterPullDown.png"></p>

<P>To the left of the "From" entry box and the right of the "To" entry box 
are double arrowed buttons.  These buttons will jump the date filtering 
forward and backward by a unit of time equal to the current filtering date 
range.  For example, if you have filtered the data in the Time Log such that 
only one week of data is showing, pressing these buttons will cause the 
filtering to move backward or forward by one week at a time.</p>

<P>The "From" and "To" entry boxes are places where specific dates can be 
entered.  The format of the date entry depends upon Java localization 
settings, which can be overridden by an entry in the configuration file.</P>

<h2>Time entries</h2>
<P>To change data in the time entries, just pick on the element that you would
like to change.  The elements in the time entries pane are editable.  The
"Logged To" column shows the process phase to which the time was logged.  If
you edit values in this column, you must type the name of a hierarchy phase
exactly;  capitalization, spacing, etc. are all significant.  If you type an
invalid value, the editor will restore the original value. The "Start T"
column shows the start time for the activity.  The "Delta" column shows the
length of time spent in the activity.  The "Int" column shows the amount of
time that the given activity was interrupted.</P>

<h2>Control buttons</h2>
<P>The Add and Delete buttons allow the addition and deletion of time 
entries.  When Add is chosen, by default the last entry in the time log will 
be copied into a new log entry.  You can choose which entry will be copied to 
make the new time entry by picking one of the entries before clicking the Add 
button.</P>

<P>The Save and Revert buttons will save the changes or revert the entries to 
their previous values.</P>

<P>The Summarize button will collapse all time entries that were logged to 
the same process phase into one entry.  The Dashboard will create new entries 
each time that it starts recording time in a given process phase (i.e. when a 
process phase is left and then returned to again for more time measurement).  
This function will allow you to collaspe all the duplicates.</P>
