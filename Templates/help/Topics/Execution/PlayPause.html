<H1>Using the Play/Pause Button</H1>

<P>The play/pause button gives access to the timer that is built into the 
dashboard.</P>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/PointToPlayPauseButton.png"></p>

<P>The dashboard timer makes it easy to measure the amount of time spent on
various tasks.  When you start the timer, it will automatically make
appropriate entries in your <a href="UsingTimeLogEditor.html">time log</a> for
the <a href="HierarchyMenus.html">currently active</a> project/task.</P>

<p>When the timer is stopped, the paused icon will have a soft blue glow:</p>

<p><img src="../../Images/DashboardStopped.png"></p>

<p>When the timer is running, the play icon will have a soft green glow:</p>

<p><img src="../../Images/DashboardRunning.png"></p>

<p>It is <b>not</b> necessary to stop the timer before changing the active
task.  You can leave the timer in "play" mode as you move from one task to
another, and it will properly finalize one entry in the time log, and open
another.</p>

<a name="timelogdelay"></a><p>When you start the timer on a new task, you will
notice that the dashboard will not create an entry in the time log until you
have spent a full minute there; this is by design.  Navigating from one task
to another may require multiple interactions with the active task selector,
which necessarily implies that the "active" project/task will momentarily pass
through several intermediate states before finally arriving at the desired
task.  You would <u>not</u> want the dashboard to create extraneous entries in
the time log for all those intermediate tasks; therefore, the dashboard waits
and creates the time log entry only after you have logged 60 seconds worth of
elapsed time to an activity.</p>

<a name="sound"></a><P>When you start the timer, it will make a short
"clicking" sound to let you know it is timing you.  You can leave the timer
running as you move from task to task and project to project, and it will play
the "timing sound" as you navigate to each new project/task.  Once again, the
sound is there to remind you that the dashboard is timing you; the sound will
<b>not</b> play if the timer is not running.  Therefore, as you move from one
project/task to another, if you expect to hear the sound and do not (or vice
versa), check the state of the timer.</p>

<p>When you first begin using the dashboard, it may be difficult to
remember to start and stop the dashboard timer.  A timing reminder
feature is available to help; see the <a
href="SystemTray.html#timingReminder">system tray icon</a> help topic
for more information.</p>

<a name="pullDown"></a><h2>The play/pause button pull-down control</h2>

<P>The play/pause button contains a pull-down control that can be used to
quickly jump to a project/task where you have recently recorded time.  This
provides another way of navigating to a task where you were recently
working.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/PointToPlayPausePullDownShowMenu.png"></p>

<P>In this example, the individual had recently been working through the
phases in a PSP2.1 project, when they were interrupted by an incoming email
message.  After finishing with the email message, they could select one of the
entries in this pull-down list.  The dashboard would activate the selected
task and begin logging time there.</p>

<p>As this example illustrates, the items in the pull-down are not limited
to the phases of the current project. Therefore, the pull-down control is
very useful when you are juggling several activities. If you keep bouncing
back and forth between several unrelated tasks, you can quickly jump to a
recent activity and log time there by using the pull-down menu.</P>

<p>If you accidentally leave the timer running and begin logging time to a
task that has been <a href="CompletionButton.html">marked complete</a>, a
warning message will be displayed.  The only purpose of this warning is to
give you a heads-up in case you are logging time by accident.  If you do not
wish to receive these alerts, you can indicate that preference as you
dismiss the dialog.</p>
