<H1>Using the completion checkbox</H1>

<P>As you complete the activities for a given process task, you should mark
that task as completed via the completion checkbox.</P>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/PointToCompletionButton.png"></p>

<P>When the completion checkbox is pressed, the dashboard moves the currently
active task to the next item in the rightmost hierarchy menu.  If the 
timer is currently running, it will automatically stop recording time for the 
given phase and start the timing of the next phase.  For more information on 
using the timer, see the <a href="PlayPause.html">Using the Play/Pause 
button</A> help topic.</P>

<P>Phases marked as complete will show a little checkmark in the completion 
checkbox.  (If you hover the mouse over the checked box, the tooltip will tell
you exactly what date and time the phase was marked complete.)</P>

<P>If you need to go back to a previous phase in a given process, you can 
still do so even if the completion checkbox has been pressed. The dashboard 
will still accumulate time in whatever phase you make current.</P>

<h2 NO_NUMBER>Marking a <i>phase</i> complete vs marking the
<i>project</i> complete</h2>

<p>By default, a project will be considered complete when all the phases in 
the project have been marked complete. However, if you manually edit the 
project completion date on the plan summary form (either via the input field 
or the checkbox), then you have manually overridden this behavior. From then 
on, the project completion status must be edited manually; it will no longer 
respond to changes in phase completion status. (Actually, you can restore the 
default behavior by typing <code><b>DEFAULT</b></code> in the project 
completion date input field on the plan summary form.)</p>

<h2 NO_NUMBER>Why should I bother marking the phases/projects complete?</h2>

<P>It is worth remembering that the "To Date" data entries, the data analysis
reports, and the PROBE tool only use data from projects that are marked
complete, so it is good to make a habit of marking your projects complete,
either with the completion checkbox or via the Project Plan Summary form.</p>

<P>Also remember that the task and schedule tool tracks your progress by
looking to see which tasks have been marked complete, so it is good to make a 
habit of marking phases complete. To help you keep track of what has and 
hasn't been marked complete, the hierarchy menus will display a checkmark to 
the right of completed tasks.</p>
