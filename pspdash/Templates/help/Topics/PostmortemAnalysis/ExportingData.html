<H1>Exporting your data</H1>
<P>Presently the dashboard provides two methods of exporting data to other 
applications.</p>

<h2>Creating an ASCII flat file</h2>
<P>You can create an ASCII file of your data by choosing Export from the "C" 
menu.  Doing so will bring up the following tool:</p>

<P><img src="../../Images/ExportTool-Data.png"></p>

<P>The Export tool presents the project hierarchy in a pane on the left, and 
options to export either your process data or the hierarchy list.</p>

<h3>Exporting data</h3>
<P>If you choose to export your data, only the process nodes that have 
actually measured data will be written to a file in the following format:</p>

<pre>/complete/path/to/data/item,&lt;value&gt;</pre>

<P>For example   <B><EM>[more to come]</em></b>

<h3>Exporting the Hierarchy list</h3>
<P>If you choose to export the hierarchy list, the entire hierarchy tree will 
be written to a file.  The file will have the form of one entry per line in 
the following format:</p>

<pre>/complete/path/to/data/item</pre>

<h2>Exporting data to Excel (PC only)</h2>
<p>Many of the reporting forms in the dashboard have links that say "Export 
to Excel...".  When this link is clicked, an Excel sheet will come up that 
contains the data from that form.</p>

<P>There is a subtle difference between the way that this export is handled 
in Netscape versus the way it is handled in Internet Explorer.</p>

<ul>
 <li>In Netscape, the sheet will have static data elements that contain the 
   values of the process variables at the instant that the export was 
   done.</li>
 <li>In Internet Explorer, the sheet will be a linked spreadsheet.  Excel 
   will connect to the dashboard and retrieve the data items.  Excel will 
   typically also display a floating "External data" toolbar, which can be 
   used to refresh the data (as long as the dashboard is still running).  By 
   clicking the "Data Range Properties" button on this floating toolbar, 
   Excel can be configured to refresh the data automatically whenever the 
   spreadsheet is opened.</li>
</ul>

<P>The "Export to Excel..." option will appear on 
<UL>
 <li>tables that are displayed by clicking on a graphical chart (see <a 
   href="DataChartsAndReports.html#charts">Data Charts and Reports</a> for
   more information)</li>
 <li>the table that is displayed when you click on the "historical data" link 
   from a PSP1.0 or higher process script</li>
 <li>the HTML time log</li>
 <li>the HTML defect log</li>
 <li>the R3 report</li>
 <li>the R4 report</li>
</ul></p>
