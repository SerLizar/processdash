<h1>Defining a Metrics Collection Framework (Process Mentor)</h1>

<p>When implementing any metrics program, an organization must decide
upon a well-defined set of process metrics that they will
collect. Without precisely-defined metrics, data collected by
individuals cannot meaningfully be consolidated and analyzed at the
team level.</p>

<p>For high-maturity processes inspired by PSP<sup> (SM)</sup> and
TSP<sup> (SM)</sup>, these definitions include:</p>

<ul>

<li>The size metrics that will be used estimate and measure product
size</li>

<li>The process phases that will be used to characterize defect
injection and removal</li>

</ul>


<p>Choosing a particular set of size metrics and process phases will
result in a unique <b>metrics collection framework</b>, which can be
used in the planning and execution of a team project.</p>

<p>However, most people (even individuals with years of process
improvement experience) underestimate the complexity involved in
defining a good metrics collection framework. A good metrics
collection framework will allow an organization to grow and improve
their process without invalidating the wealth of historical data they
have collected.</p>

<p>The following mistakes are common when creating a new high-maturity
metrics collection framework:</p>

<ul>

<li>Making the phases or size metrics too specific, such that slight
changes in the organizational process make the metrics no longer
apply.</li>

<li>Making the phases or size metrics too granular, such that the
burden of collecting actual data becomes overwhelming for individuals.</li>

</ul>


<p>To help teams avoid these mistakes, two fully-vetted metrics collection
frameworks are available for use with the Process Dashboard.  The first and
most common option is the TSP<sup>(SM)</sup>.  A second "PDSSD" framework is
provided for organizations that develop both hardware and software.  These two
frameworks are included in the general-purpose Process Dashboard installer,
which can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.processdash.com/download"

<p>Teams are strongly encouraged to use one of these frameworks if it meets
their needs. However, the Process Dashboard can support custom metrics
collection frameworks for organizations that need this functionality (for
example, teams that do not write software).  An editor and generator for
custom metrics frameworks is available at:</p>
