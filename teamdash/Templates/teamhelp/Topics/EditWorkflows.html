<h1>Plan Project Development Process</h1>
<b>(TSP Launch Meeting No. 3)</b>

<p>In the next step of the project launch process, the team typically
formalizes the steps in their development process. To do this, you may
draw upon existing organizational processes, or you may define new
processes as a team during the launch. The team may create defined
processes, or they may simply identify common, repeatable workflows.
The Process Dashboard provides tools that assist with this task.</p>

<p>If your team is defining new processes from scratch, it is often a
good idea to use a whiteboard, easel, and other traditional meeting
aids to capture the team's ideas, as this helps to promote the free
flow of ideas. When the team processes begin to solidify, it is
helpful to have an individual enter these into the dashboard. (On the
other hand, if your process definitions take a long time to solidify,
it may be more helpful to wait until after the meeting is over to
enter the process steps into the dashboard.)</p>

<p>Processes and workflows are entered into the Common Team Workflows
Editor. From the Work Breakdown Structure Editor window, you can
access the Common Team Workflows Editor by selecting the Workflow menu
and choosing Edit Workflows.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/workflows-empty.png"></p>

<p>Processes and workflows are once again displayed hierarchically and
edited in an outline format. (For more in-depth information on editing
this outline, see the <a href="EditingTheWBS.html">Editing the Work
Breakdown Structure</a> help topic.) In this hierarchical outline,
each item that is a direct child of the Common Workflows node
represents a single <i>process</i> or <i>workflow</i>.  These items
are displayed with an icon depicting a structured bundle (<img
border=0 width=15 height=15 src="../Images/icon-process.png">).  You
can designate a given node as a process or workflow by un-indenting it
as far to the left as possible.</p>

<p>Define the steps in a process or workflow by creating items
hierarchically underneath it. Underneath a process or workflow, you
can define documents that will be created and tasks that will be
performed. To define the type of each item you create, click on its
icon to display a menu. When defining a high-maturity process, make
certain to select the most appropriate process phase for each task you
create.</p>


<p>You are not limited in the number of processes/workflows you can
create. Each process/workflow, however, should be given a unique
name.</p>

<p>The four columns on the right are completely optional, but entering
data can save you a great deal of time later.</p>

<ul>

<li style='margin-top:9pt'>The Rate and Units columns allow you to
include typical productivity rates (based on historical or estimated
team averages) for a given task. For example, you might wish to state
that a Code Review task takes place at a rate of 200 LOC/Hr, or that a
PSP Task completes at a rate of 20 LOC/Hr. <i>If you do not have any
idea of the expected productivity for a given task, enter a zero in
the rate column</i>.</li>


<li style='margin-top:9pt'>The % column provides a convenient way to
divide a larger task proportionately. Often, you may know the
historical end-to-end productivity rate for an entire process, and you
may know the percentage breakdowns for the steps in that process. In
that case, you can use the % column to designate that breakdown.

<p style='margin-top:9pt'>An example can illustrate this best. Imagine
a hypothetical organizational process for crisis management. The
phases in this process are named Planning, Stop, Drop, Roll, and
Postmortem.  Historical data indicates that an individual enacting the
process can address three crises per hour. Furthermore, the data
indicates that the phases take 5%, 10%, 10%, 40%, and 35% of the total
time, respectively. Then the correct way to capture the process would
be as follows:</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/workflow-rate-example.png"></p>

<p>It is worth noting, however, that the % column is strictly provided
for convenience. In particular, there is no requirement that
percentages must add to 100. If you do not need to use the percentage
column to capture your productivity historical data, you can leave it
at the default value of 100%.</p></li>


<li style='margin-top:9pt'>The # People column allows you to indicate
that a particular task is generally performed by a group of
individuals. For example, if you created a Code Review task in your
process, you might wish to indicate that five people typically
participate in a Code Review.

<p>It is worth noting that this column is completely independent of
the previous three columns. Thus, if you know that your team
historically spends 15% of a project in code review, but five people
are typically involved in that review, you would observe that each
person is actually spending 3% of the overall time. In this case, 3
would be the correct value to put in the % column.</p></li>

</ul>


<p>There is not a Save button on the Common Team Workflows
Editor. Instead, workflow definitions are automatically saved when you
save the main work breakdown structure. To save, switch back to the
main Work Breakdown Structure Editor window and select Save from the
File menu.</p>


<p>Two buttons on the toolbar provide the ability to import (<img
border=0 width=61 height=28 src="../Images/workflow-import-button.png">) and
export (<img border=0 width=61 height=28
src="../Images/workflow-export-button.png">) workflows. This makes it
possible to share workflows between projects and between project
teams. When you click one of these buttons, the workflow editor will
ask you to identify the name of a workflow library file. You can
export workflows to a new or existing library file, or import
workflows from an existing file. After choosing a file, the
Import/Export Team Workflows window will appear. This window shows the
workflows from the current project in a table on the left, and the
workflows from the library in a table on the right.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/workflow-import-export-dialog.png"></p>

<p>When exporting, you can select a workflow in the table on the left
and click the Add button to export it to the library on the
right. When importing, you can select a workflow in the library table
on the right and click the Add button to import it to the project
workflows on the left.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/workflow-import-add-example.png"></p>

<p>Workflows are identified by their names (for example, &quot;Crisis
Management&quot; in the image below). If you import or export a
workflow which has the same name as an existing workflow in the
destination table, the existing workflow will be overwritten. For
example, in the image below, the user is importing workflows from an
existing library.  They have selected the &quot;Crisis
Management&quot; workflow in the library on the right. Since there is
already a workflow by that name in the project workflow list on the
left, the application has automatically highlighted it, and changed
the text on the Add button to &quot;Overwrite,&quot; indicating that
if this workflow is imported it will overwrite the workflow that is
highlighted on the left.</p>

<p class="figure"><img
   src="../Images/workflow-import-overwrite-example.png"></p>

<p>At times, you may wish to import all the workflows in a library, or
export all of the workflows in your project. The Add All button will
perform this task. Keep in mind that any existing workflows with the
same names will be overwritten, as described in the paragraph
above.</p>

<p>The changes you make in the Import/Export Team Workflows window
will not be saved until you click the Import or Export button at the
bottom of the window. (Only one of these buttons will appear,
depending on whether you chose to import workflows or export
workflows.) When you click the Export button, the changes you made to
the workflow library will be saved to the named file. When you click
the Import button, the changes you made to the project workflows will
be applied to the contents of the Common Team Workflows Editor. When
importing or exporting, if you make a mistake or change your mind,
just click the Cancel button and no changes will be saved.</p>
