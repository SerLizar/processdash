<P>The Process Dashboard is 100% Java, and will run on any system with a Java 2 
compliant virtual machine. This includes Windows, Linux, and Unix systems. (We 
haven't yet had an opportunity to test it on a Macintosh system, but don't 
anticipate any problems; we would love to <A 
href="mailto:processdash-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">hear from</A> a Macintosh 
user who would like to give the dashboard a try.)&nbsp; For access to forms and 
scripts, a web browser is also required.</P>
<P>To use the process dashboard, you must <B>first</B> install the following software:</P>

<P>Netscape 6.0 is currently not capable of supporting the process dashboard. If 
you are a Netscape 6.0 user, don't worry - you don't need to give up your 
favorite browser. You still have two options for running the dashboard: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>
  <DIV>Netscape will allow you to have several versions of Communicator 
  installed on your computer without conflict. So you can install Netscape 4.7 
  on your computer for use with the dashboard, and keep using Netscape 6.0 as 
  your system-default web browser. </DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV>Or, you can avoid installing multiple versions of Netscape by using 
  Internet Explorer with the dashboard while keeping Netscape 6.0 as your system 
  default. (Unless you really dislike IE, this may be the simplest option. And 
  for what it's worth, IE does work better with the dashboard than Netscape.)

<P>When it starts up, the dashboard automatically searches the 
directory containing the "pspdash.jar" file for other files ending with the ".jar" extension. Any 
files it finds that match this pattern are interpreted as add-on process sets, and 
imported into the tool. </P>
<P>Therefore, if you decide you want to save an old "pspdash.jar" file by 
renaming it, make certain that it no longer ends with ".jar". Otherwise, older 
versions of the built-in processes may interfere with the new versions that come 
with the dashboard. </P>
<P>The easiest way to avoid all this trouble is just to overwrite the old 
"pspdash.jar" file with the new version you download. </P></A>
