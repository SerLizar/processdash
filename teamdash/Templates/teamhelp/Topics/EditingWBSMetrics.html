<h1>Editing Metrics in the Work Breakdown Structure Editor</h1>

<p>In the Work Breakdown Structure Editor, the right-hand side of the
screen contains several tabs. These tabs display various collections
of metrics for the items in your WBS. Select a tab to view or edit
those metrics.</p>

<p>Within these metrics panels, several typesetting conventions are
used to convey information. </p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/wbs-with-time-estimates.png"></p>

<p>For example, gray text is used to indicate read-only data. If text
is not gray, you can edit it directly. For example, in the second line
of the table above, you can see that Component&nbsp;A is estimated to
contain 1,230 lines of code, and take 94.8 hours. You may edit these
numbers directly! (This often takes people by surprise, as many
planning tools do not permit you to edit top-down values.)  This
feature can be very useful and powerful for planning. For example,
historical data rates (inherited from a process/workflow definition)
may have produced the estimate of 94.8 hours for Component A. If your
team feels that Component A is more complex and will require
additional time, simply edit the value 94.8 and replace it with your
team's actual estimate for the component.  The time estimates for all
of the tasks underneath Component A will automatically be scaled
proportionally.</p>

<p>Some values may be displayed in a bold red font to indicate a
serious error. Hover the mouse over the value in question, and a tool
tip will explain the problem. (For example, the tasks in the picture
above have not been assigned to any team members.) Less serious
problems are highlighted with a bold blue font.</p>

<p>Support is also provided for copying and pasting metrics data from
one part of the WBS to another, and for copying and pasting data from
other programs such as Excel. If you copy a rectangle of cells in an
Excel spreadsheet, you can paste the data into a similar rectangle of
cells on the right-hand side of the WBS, and vice versa.  To copy,
type Ctrl-C; to paste, type Ctrl-V. These operations are repeated on
the Edit menu as "Copy WBS Data" and "Paste WBS Data".  (Note that the
copy and paste buttons on the toolbar will paste entirely new WBS
items into the hierarchy, rather than pasting data into existing
cells.)</p>

<p>The WBS Editor provides several default tabs showing preset
collections of data, but you are not limited to those tabs. To support
team-specific planning styles, click the "New Tab" that appears to the
right of the preexisting tabs. You can customize the columns that
appear on your new tab by selecting Tabs&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Change Tab
Columns. Although you can alter the columns that appear on your custom
tabs, the original tabs will always remain the same; this provides
continuity for other coaches or mentors that need to look at your team
plan.</p>
