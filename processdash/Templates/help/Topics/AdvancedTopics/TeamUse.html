<H1>Team Use</H1>

The process dashboard includes functionality which can be used by the
individuals on a software project team.</p>

<p>Different teams have different needs.  When using the dashboard to
plan and track your project, there are at least three different
approaches you could take.  These approaches (from simplest to more
advanced) are:

<ol>

<li><a href="TeamUseEV.html">Rollup Earned Value Only</a></li>
<li><a href="TeamUsePSPEV.html">Rollup PSP Data and Earned Value</a></li>
<li><a href="TeamUseCustomProcess.html">Rollup Custom Process Data and
    Earned Value</a></li>

</ol>

<!-- 

<p>The Process Dashboard maintains an internal repository of metrics data,
which is used to produce historical data views, "To Date" rollups, etc.
When you begin consolidating team data, it is a good idea to do this in a
new repository.  By creating a separate repository for team data, you avoid
the risk of accidentally including team metrics in the data analysis for a
particular individual.  You also avoid the risk of accidentally including
unrelated personal metrics in the team rollup.</p>

<p>The Process Dashboard reads and saves its metrics repository to files in
the "current working directory" when the dashboard is run.  Thus, to create
a new metrics repository, all you need to do is (a)&nbsp;create an empty
directory to hold the data, and (b)&nbsp;run the dashboard with that
directory as the "current working directory".  To reliably and repeatably
perform the second step, you'll probably want to create a new "shortcut" to
run the dashboard, which specifies the "current working directory"
appropriately.  (For more help and instructions for performing this step,
see the <a href="../Troubleshooting/FAQ.html#WhereData">Frequently Asked
Questions</a> help topic.</p>
