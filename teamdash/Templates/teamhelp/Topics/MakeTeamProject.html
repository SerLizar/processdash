<h1>Create a Team Project (Team Leader)</h1>

<p>Creating a team project is simple, thanks to a Team Project Setup
Wizard included in the Tools for Team Leaders add-on. To create a new
team project, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>

 <li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>Start the Team Dashboard using the
     appropriately named shortcut on the team leader's computer. The
     Team Dashboard will open. (If your personal dashboard
     is also running, you can easily distinguish the
     Team Dashboard because it displays "Team Dashboard" in the
     title bar, and displays a different icon for the window.)</li>

 <li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>On the C menu of the team dashboard,
     choose the Hierarchy menu item. The Hierarchy Editor window will
     appear.</li>

 <li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>In the Hierarchy Editor, highlight a
     node in the hierarchy such as the top-level Project node. On the
     Edit menu, choose Add Template&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Team Project. A
     new node called Team Project will be created; give it a short
     name that describes your project.  Choose
     File&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Save, then
     File&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Close.</li>

 <li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>Using the dashboard Hierarchy Menus,
     navigate to the project you just created. Click the dashboard
     Script Button to display the Team Project Setup Wizard.</li>

 <li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>The Team Project Setup Wizard will walk
     you through the steps involved in creating a team project. Read
     each page carefully and supply the information requested. One
     page of the wizard will ask whether you wish to create a team
     project or a master project; choose the Team Project option.</li>

 <li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>At one point, the Team Project Setup Wizard will
     give you an opportunity to select the directory where you would like to
     store data for this team project.  By default, it will encourage you to
     store data into the <a href="TeamConfigDir.html">team configuration
     directory</a>.  Most teams are <b>strongly</b> encouraged to keep this
     default, as it is simpler and less confusing to keep all your data in one
     place.  If you have a compelling need to place <i>team project</i> data in
     a separate location than <i>configuration</i> data, you can alter this
     path.  However, the directory you choose <b><u>must meet</u></b> all of
     the same <a href="TeamConfigDir.html#criteria">accessibility and
     permissions criteria</a> as the team configuration directory.</li>

 <li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>When the wizard finishes, you can close
     the browser window.</li>

</ol>
