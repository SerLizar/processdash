<P>The Size Estimating Template is used to help make estimates of how big a 
new software project will be or how long it will take to create the project 
(size and time estimation).  It is patterned after the Size Estimating 
Template from Watts Humphrey's book <i>A&nbsp;Self-Improvement Process
for Software Engineers</i>.</p>

<p class="ifpsp" align="center"><img src="../../Images/SizeEstimatingTemplate.png"></p>

<p>(Note: Watts Humphrey released an earlier book called <i>A&nbsp;Discipline
for Software Engineering</i> which used a very different layout for this
form.  If you are using the old version of the PSP scripts, you will see the
old form layout.  The paragraphs below describe the new version of the
form.)</p>

<P>Right near the top of the form is a link to bring up the Size Estimating
Template instructions form.  The dashboard will bring up the instructions in
a separate web browser so that the two can be placed side by side on your
screen.</p>

<P>Also, there are several links on the form that will add rows to the form.  
If you need more room than the form provides, just click on the appropriate 
link and it will expand for you.</p>

<P>The header section contains entries for the name of the project and your 
name.  Both of these fields should be automatically filled in by the 
dashboard (if your name does not appear, go ahead and enter it -- it will 
show up on the other forms as well).</p>

<p>The Size Estimating Template can theoretically be used to estimate any
type of work, so the official version of this form includes a header field
describing the unit of size measurement used for the numbers on the form.
However, the PSP process definitions are currently focused on support for
software development, so this value will be hardcoded to "LOC" for PSP
tasks.  If you are using the Size Estimating Template in conjunction with
a <a href="../Overview/ProcessScripts.html#generic">generic project</a>,
you should enter the appropriate size metric in this field.</p>

<h2><a name="baseLOC"></a>Base Parts</h2>

<p>The Base Parts section is where you enter the information about any
preexisting components that may need modifications during the course of
your project.  If you have several of these components, you can use a
separate line for each.</p>

<p>The form has blanks for both Estimated and Actual sets of data.  When
using this form for planning purposes, the Estimated columns should get
filled in.  After the project is finished and you are in the postmortem
phase, you should enter data in the Actual columns.</p>

<P>The form asks for the base size and the size of deleted, added, and
modified elements.  In the BASE column, enter the size of the preexisting
component. For example if you are creating a modification to an already
existing program, the LOC from the existing program count as base LOC.</p>

<p>In the next three columns, you estimate the size of deleted, modified, and
added elements.  For example, you would enter the number of existing LOC you
think you might delete, the number of existing LOC you think you might
modify, and some number of new LOC you think you might add.  A histogram
appears to show you how these numbers relate to the size of the preexisting,
base program.  You can drag sliders to estimate an approximate
percentage.</p>

<h2><a name="baseAdditions"></a>Parts Additions</h2>

<P>Parts Additions is the section where you will record the bulk of new
development in most of your projects.  This section allows you to estimate
the new components you believe you will create during the course of this
project.  These could be new objects, new files, new functions, new
subroutines, new methods, etc. - whatever makes the most sense for your
estimating needs.</p>

<p>Blanks are provided to enter the description of each added part, the type
of part that is being added, the number of items that are going to be added
of this type, the relative size of these items, and the numeric
estimate/measure of the size of each added part.</p>

<P>When you are estimating in LOC (for example, for a PSP task), the type
field will include a default set of categories: namely Calculation,
Data, I/O, Logic, Setup or Text.  However, you can define your own categories
by clicking on the hyperlink at the top of the column.  New PSP users should
usually stick to the preset types; as you gain experience, you may use your
PSP training to define your own proxy categories.  Select the category that
best fits the type of each added part.</p>

<P>The number of items can be useful when you are estimating a high-level
object.  For example, if you are estimating the size of an object or class in
an object-oriented language, you could use this field to record the number of
methods that will be present in an object you plan to create.  If you are
using some custom proxy type category, this field could capture the count of
proxy elements you plan to produce.  If these scenarios don't apply, you can
leave this field blank or enter the number "1".</p>

<P>The relative size pull down allows you to choose from subjective size
categories such as Very Small, Small, Medium, Large, and Very Large.  To
produce the most accurate estimates, you should aim for a level of planning
granularity that allows most of your planned parts to be of Medium size, with
a balance of smaller and larger parts.</P>

<p>After you enter values in the previous three columns, the data in the
proxy category table will be used to produce an estimated size.  If the
generated number seems too big or too small, choose a different relative
size.</p>

<p>As you enter new parts, consider whether each new part is sufficiently
general purpose that it can be checked into a reuse library.  Generally this
means more than just code that can probably be reused in the general sense.
It usually has to do with proper packaging of the code as well: Are proper
interfaces defined?  Is the code sufficiently well documented?  Etc.  If you
intend to design the code for reuse, put a check mark in the NR (New Reusable)
column.</p>

<h2><a name="reusedObjects"></a>Reused Parts</h2>

<P>Reused parts are objects that are brought into the program from a reuse
library and used verbatim.  New PSP users can sometimes be confused by the
line between a reused part and a base part.  The main rule is that you must
not count the same component as both base and reused - otherwise the size
accounting formulas will not work out correctly.  In addition, the form will
not let you enter added/deleted/modified size for reused parts, so you should
only put items in the reused parts section if they can be reused with no
changes.</p>

<h2><a name="time"></a>Performing the size/time estimation</h2>

<P>Once you have thought through all the changes that are going to be made to
the software, you are ready to calculate a prediction of size and or time.
The form will add up numbers from the sections above to produce an Estimated
Proxy Size, which the PROBE method will use as your base estimate.</p>

<p class="ifpsp" align="center"><img src="../../Images/ProbeWizardLink.png"></p>

<P>The Size Estimation Template offers a link that will allow you to choose 
the PROBE Wizard to help you make your estimates.  If you use the PROBE 
Wizard, it will read your Estimated Proxy Size off the size estimating 
template automatically, and will save your chosen estimates back to the size 
estimating template automatically. For more information about using the PROBE 
Wizard, see the <a href="UsingProbeWizard.html">Using the PROBE Wizard</a> 
help topic.</p>

<P>On the other hand, if you use the PROBE tool, you will need to type the 
Estimated Proxy Size into the Estimate field on the tool. Once you have 
investigated the relationships among your process data, you should manually 
copy your final estimates back to the size estimating template, along with 
the various other measures that come about as a result of the estimation 
(<i>B</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>B</i><sub>1</sub>, UPI, LPI, prediction range, 
r<sup>2</sup>, probe method selected). If you use PROBE method C or D, the 
Prediction Range field and the other numeric fields below it can be left 
blank. For more information about the PROBE tool provided by the dashboard, 
see the <a href="UsingProbeTool.html">Using the PROBE tool</a> help topic.</p>

<h2><a name="postmortem"></a>Entering Actual data during Postmortem</h2>

<P>Once you reach the Postmortem phase and you have the Actual size data, 
you should return to this form to enter the actuals for the various measures 
on the form (base, deleted, modified, and added size, counts for the 
various objects, etc.).</p> 

<p class="ifpsp" align="center"><img src="../../Images/QSEnterActualLOC.png"></p>

<P>That's all the data that has to be entered on this form.  The dashboard
calculates as much of the data for you as possible.  The numbers entered and
calculated on this form will automatically appear on the Project Plan Summary
form.</p>
