<H1>Counting LOC</H1>

Measuring size is an important step in the PSP Postmortem phase. If you don't
pause in your project postmortem to measure the number of added, deleted, and
modified LOC, you may forever lose the opportunity to capture these
metrics. It only takes a few moments, and provides you with valuable data
for future planning efforts.
<P>You may already have a LOC counter that you use on a regular basis. (In
fact, most people who complete the PSP training course write a LOC counter
during the training.) If you do need a LOC counter, one is built into the
dashboard. A link to this LOC counter is included in the Postmortem scripts
for PSP0.1 and up.</P>
<P>The built-in LOC counter helps to determine the number of physical LOC
that you have added, deleted, and modified. It also displays a
&quot;redlined&quot; version of the program file, which can be <I>very</I>
useful for peer reviews.</P>
<P>If you want to measure the size of a newly created file, just leave the
&quot;Initial File&quot; section blank, and put the newly created file in
the &quot;Modified File&quot; section.</P>
