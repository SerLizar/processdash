<h1>Step 2: Planning the project</h1>

<P>Now that the project exists, we can start the planning of our work.  The 
PSP provides scripts for planning, development, postmortem work, etc., so 
let's go look at the planning script for our new PSP1.1 project.  This is done 
by selecting our newly created project via the hierarchy menus (the dashboard 
will automatically select the planning phase -- the first development phase 
of a PSP1.1 project), then clicking the scripts button.  We should also click 
the play button on the dashboard to start timing our planning activities.  
When the play button is pressed, a quiet "clicking" sound will be heard.  
This sound will be heard anytime the dashboard switches phases of activity 
while the clock is running.</p>

<P><center><img src="../../Images/QSChoosingPlanning.png"></center></p>

<P>The dashboard responds by bringing up the PSP1.1 planning script in a web 
browser.  Reading through the script, we see that once we understand the 
requirements for program 5A, we need to do a size estimate.  To guide our 
estimation, we can use the PROBE method.  Following the <U>PROBE method</u> 
link on the planning script brings up the PROBE Estimating Script.</p>

<p>Reading through this script we see that once we have produced a conceptual 
design, we need to fill out the Size Estimating Template.  The dashboard 
provides both the template itself and the instruction script for its use.  
Following the link for the <U>Size Estimating Template</u> brings up a 
dynamic HTML version of the template.  For ready reference, the template has 
a link near the top to display the Size Estimating Template instructions 
form.  If you click on this link, a second browser will be started so that 
you can have the instructions and the template side by side on your screen.  
For more information on the Size Estimating Template, see the <a 
href="../Planning/UsingSizeEstimatingTemplate.html">Size Estimating 
Template</a> help topic.</p>

<p><center><img src="../../Images/QSShowSizeEstimatingTemplateTop.png"></center></p>

<P>The Size Estimating Template Instructions direct us to count the base LOC 
and enter it at entry B if this is an enhancement of a previous program.  
Program 5A is a new program, so the whole base program LOC and base additions 
sections don't apply.  We will leave those entries with their default values 
of 0.</p>

<P>New objects will be a place for most of our estimating.  The student who 
produced the data used for this example estimated that 5 new objects would be 
created.  Their types, number of methods, and LOC estimates are entered under 
the new objects section of the form.  The "add more rows for new objects" 
link will expand the form with more entries if chosen.</p>

<P>The student who worked this problem did not have any entries for the 
reused objects section of the form, so we will skip that section as well.</P>

<P>Moving on to the size calculation, we need to calculate the estimated new 
&amp; changed LOC using PROBE. There are at least two ways to do this: with
the PROBE Wizard or with the PROBE tool. (The PROBE Wizard automates
the standard PSP PROBE process, and is simpler to use; the PROBE tool is
more complex to use but provides more power for custom statistical
analyses). For this example, we will use the PROBE Wizard. After you
complete the top portion of the Size Estimating Template, you can launch
the PROBE wizard by clicking on the hyperlink halfway down the page.</P>

<P>The PROBE Wizard consists of a series of dialogs that guide you through 
the PROBE process.</P>

<P>The PROBE script gives several ways to calculate an estimate. The PROBE
Wizard displays these methods side by side and ranks them, advising us
which method may be the most reliable. By simply following the prompts, we
decide in this example to select method C2 for size and then choose C2 for
time. As we make these choices, the resulting values are automatically
written into the appropriate fields of the Size Estimating Template. After 
our planning efforts on this form it looks like the following:</p>

<p><center><img src="../../Images/QSSizeEstimatingTemplateDone.png"></center></p>

<P>When we bring up the Project Plan Summary, we see that the planning data 
is all entered automatically.  Time to click the little done button on the 
dashboard and move on into design!</p>

<p><center><img src="../../Images/QSFinishPlanning.png"></center></p>

<P>Note also that when the dashboard moves into a new phase while the timer 
is running, a little "clicking" noise is made.  This little bit of feedback 
assures us that the timer is still running.</p>
