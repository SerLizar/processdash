<h1>Custom JSP Reporting</h1>

<p>The Process Dashboard contains an embedded web server for the display of
process scripts, reports, charts, and other materials.  Beginning in version
2.1, this server is based on the Jetty JSP engine.  This makes it possible to
develop custom reports using standard Java technologies, and run them against
the project data in the Team Dashboard.</p>

<p>For in-depth documentation on this functionality, please visit:<br>
