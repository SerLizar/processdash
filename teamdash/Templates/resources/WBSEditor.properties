    The Work Breakdown Structure Editor attempted to open\n\
    project data located in:\n\

    Unfortunately, this file/directory could not be found.\n\
    You may need to map a network drive to edit this data.

    WBS data.
Errors.Cannot_Open.Lock_FMT=\
    The Work Breakdown Structure Editor encountered an\n\
    unexpected error during startup: another process on\n\
    this computer seems to be locking the WBS data for\n\
    this project.  To prevent data corruption, this program\n\
    must exit.\n\

Errors.Lost_Lock.Title=Network Connectivity Problems
Errors.Lost_Lock.Message=\
    Although you opened the work breakdown structure in read-write\n\
    mode, your connection to the network was broken, and your lock\n\
    on the WBS was lost.  In the meantime, another individual has\n\
    opened the work breakdown structure for editing, so your lock\n\
    could not be reclaimed.\n\
    \ \n\
    As a result, you will no longer be able to save changes to the\n\
    work breakdown structure.  You are strongly encouraged to close\n\
    and reopen the work breakdown structure editor.
Errors.Lost_Lock.Save_Advice=\
    To avoid losing your changes, you may wish to choose "Save a Copy"\n\
    from the "File" menu.

Errors.Open_Read_Only.Title=Open Project in Read-Only Mode
Errors.Open_Read_Only.Prompt=\
    Would you like to open the project anyway, in read-only mode?

Errors.Concurrent_Use.Message_FMT=\
    The Work Breakdown Structure for this project is currently\n\
    locked for editing by {0}.
Errors.Concurrent_Use.Anonymous_User=someone on another machine

Errors.Read_Only_Files.Message_FMT=\
    The Work Breakdown Structure Editor stores data for this project\n\
    into XML files located at:\n\
    \        {0}\n\
    \ \n\
    Unfortunately, the current filesystem permissions do not allow\n\
    you to modify those files.

Errors.Cannot_Create_Lock.Message_FMT=\
    The Work Breakdown Structure Editor stores data for this project\n\
    into XML files located at:\n\
    \        {0}\n\
    \ \n\
    The WBS Editor attempted to lock those files for writing, but the\n\
    operating system was unable to secure a write lock.  This is an\n\
    unusual situation, possibly caused by the current configuration of\n\
    the remote network directory.

Recommend_Read_Only.Title=Open Read-Only?
Recommend_Read_Only.Option_Read_Write=Open in read-write mode
Recommend_Read_Only.Option_Read_Only=Open in read-only mode
Recommend_Read_Only.Simultaneous_Prompt=\
    Would you like to open the WBS in read-only mode?\n\
    This is recommended if you only want to view the\n\
    data, and do not intend to make any changes.
Recommend_Read_Only.Exclusive_Prompt=\
    The Work Breakdown Structure is shared by the\n\
    entire team. If you only intend to view data\n\
    (not modify anything), you should open the WBS\n\
    in read-only mode, so others can make changes.\n\
    Which would you like to do?

Project_Closed.Title=Project / Iteration Closed
Project_Closed.Message=\
    This project / iteration has been marked "closed," and the\n\
    incomplete / in-progress work was copied to a new work\n\
    breakdown structure.\n\
    \ \n\
    You can still save changes to this WBS to perform simple\n\
    cleanups of completed tasks, and to label or categorize\n\
    items in support of postmortem data analysis. \n\
    \ \n\
    However, you should not create new tasks in this WBS or\n\
    assign tasks to individuals, because new tasks will not\n\
    be synchronized down into the personal plans of team\n\
    members.  Most ongoing changes should be made in the\n\
    WBS for the new project / iteration.

File_Replace.Confirm.Message=\
    You have requested to replace the planned data in this Work Breakdown\n\
    Structure with data from a WBS ZIP file.  This is a potentially\n\
    destructive operation, so it must be performed with care.\n\
    \ \n\
    A "replace data" operation is appropriate in some scenarios:\n\
    \ \n\
    \ \u2022 If network connectivity problems prevented you from saving\n\
    \    changes in the past; you saved your changes into a WBS data\n\
    \    zip file; you now wish to load those edits back into the team\n\
    \    plan; and no one else has edited the team plan in the meantime\n\
    \ \n\
    \ \u2022 If your team has created several alternative plans during\n\
    \    a team project launch, and you wish to make one of those\n\
    \    alternatives the official plan before the project begins\n\
    \ \n\
    \ \u2022 If you saved a WBS data file to work with it offline, you\n\
    \    wish to apply your offline changes, and no one else has altered\n\
    \    the real project WBS in the meantime\n\
    \ \n\
    When you perform a "replace data" operation, all of the data in the\n\
    current plan will be discarded and replaced with the data from the\n\
    file you specify.  Please ensure that this is your intent.\n\

Filter.Info.Applied.Header=\
    The filter operation has temporarily hidden rows from the\n\
    Work Breakdown Structure that do not match your criteria.
Filter.Info.Message=\
    Although the rows are hidden, they are still present and can\n\
    still be affected by editing operations.  (For example, if you\n\
    change the top-level time estimate for an entire component,\n\
    this will still rescale the times for all subtasks, including\n\
    subtasks that are hidden.)\n\
    \ \n\
    While the filter is in effect, you will not be able to edit the\n\
    hierarchical structure of the WBS.  For example, you will not\n\
    be able to insert, delete, or move any components or tasks.\n\

    remove the filter first.

PlanWatcher.Help.Title=Personal Editing Optimized Mode
PlanWatcher.Help.Explanation=\
    When you open the Work Breakdown Structure Editor\n\
    from your personal dashboard, the WBS will enter\n\
    "personal editing optimized mode" by default.  This\n\
    mode is designed to make it easier for you to alter\n\
    your personal plan.  For example, when you create a\n\
    new task, it will automatically be assigned to you.\n\
    \ \n\
    In addition, the WBS Editor will display a warning\n\
    if you make a change that affects a coworker's plan.\n\
    By heeding these warnings, you can make changes to\n\
    your plan with confidence, knowing that you won't\n\
    accidentally alter someone else's plan.\n\
    \ \n\
    "Personal editing optimized mode" can be very useful.\n\
    But there may be times that you wish to edit the full\n\
    team plan, including the plans of your team members.\n\
    Just open the "Team" menu and uncheck the box\n\
    labeled, "Optimizing Editing Operations for..."  This will\n\
    disable personal editing optimized mode.
