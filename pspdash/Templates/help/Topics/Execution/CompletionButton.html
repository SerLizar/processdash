<H1>Using the completion button</H1>

<P>As you complete the activities for a given process phase, you should mark
that phase as completed via the completion button.</P>

<p><img src="../../Images/PointToCompletionButton.jpg"></p>

<P>When you mark a phase as completed, the data associated with that phase 
will show up in the various Project Summary forms in the "To Date" entries, 
the data analysis reports, and the PROBE tool.  None of the forms or reports 
will show data from phases that the dashboard thinks are still ongoing.</P>

<P>When the completion button is pressed the dashboard moves the current 
phase to the next phase prescribed by the running process template.  If the 
timer is currently running, it will automatically stop recording time for the 
given phase and start the timing of the next phase.  For more information on 
using the timer, see the <a href="PlayPause.html">Using the Play/Pause 
button</A> help topic.</P>

<P>Phases marked as complete will show a little checkmark in the completion button.</P>

<P>This example shows the Planning phase of a PSP0 project marked as complete.</P>

<P>If you need to go back to a previous phases in a given process, you can 
still do so even if the completion button has been pressed.  The dashboard 
will still accumulate time in whatever phase you make current.</P>
