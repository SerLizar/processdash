<H1>The process scripts</h1>
<P>The Process Dashboard provides nearly all the scripts defined in <I>A 
Discipline for Software Engineering</i> by Watts Humphrey.  In all cases, the 
forms and scripts were designed to be as close to the "real thing" as 
possible (the "real thing" being the forms and tables in Appendix C of Watts 
Humphrey's book).  Where the online forms and scripts deviate, the text is 
color coded as follows:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Where the dashboard makes a certain step unnecessary the text is colored 
   in grey (e.g. writing entries in a time log).</li>
 <li>Where the dashboard changes the way a certain step is performed, the 
   text is colored in green (e.g. using the PROBE tool instead of performing 
   statistical calculations via a calculator or spreadsheet).</li>
</ul>

<P>Many of the process forms contain links to other forms that are used at 
that process level, making navigation through the forms simple and 
intuitive.</p>

<P>For information on how to access the forms, see the <a 
href="../Execution/AccessingScripts.html">Accessing process scripts</a> help 
topic.</p>

<p>The following lists detail the forms and scripts provided by the dashboard 
at each PSP level.  Items marked by <sup>*</sup> are "live" forms that either 
update themselves with process data (e.g. the project summary forms) or can 
be expanded as necessary to permit multiple data entry (e.g. the size 
estimating template or the PSP3 cycle summary form).</p>

<P>Starting at PSP level 2, the Project Plan Summary form gets large enough 
that it is presented in a frames view so that different pieces of it can be 
seen.  The full view is also available.  These items are marked by 
<sup>**</sup> in these lists.</p>

<h2>The "generic" process script</h2>
<P>Very much of the methodology that is employed by the PSP can be used in 
other endeavors.  Any kind of work that has measurable size, time, and 
defects can probably benefit from a PSP-like process.  The generic process 
scripts attempt to give rudimentary measurement and defect tracking for other 
work efforts.</p>

<P>The generic process script allows a planning and postmortem phase, and 
provides a form similar to the Project Plan Summary form.  It allows entry of 
estimates of time and size, and even lets you enter the size unit.  For 
example, you could run the generic process to measure and track your progress 
as you write a technical paper.  The size unit would end up being something 
related to the work of writing (perhaps pages).  The generic process would 
capture your productivity rates and allow you to enter defects.  Estimation 
support would also be available through the PROBE tool.</p>

<h2>The "timer" process script</h2>
<P>The timer process allows for estimating and measuring activities that have 
only a time aspect to them.  If you regularly perform some kind of task that 
pretty much remains the same each time, you could record estimates and times 
for that task to attempt to provide some engineering discipline.</p>
