<H1>Localization Tool</H1>

<P>The dashboard has many users around the world.  To better support
all our users, we are currently working to internationalize the
dashboard.  The Process Dashboard includes a Localization Tool that
you can use to translate dashboard messages into your own language.
You can open the Localization Tool by selecting &quot;Tools&nbsp;<img
src="../../Images/rarrow.png">&nbsp;Localization Tool&quot; from the
<a href="../Execution/ConfigureMenu.html">configure menu</a>.</P>

<p><center><img src="../../Images/LocalizationToolMenu.png"></center></p>

<P>(Note that the menu option for the localization tool will not
normally appear for English-speaking users.)  The Localization Tool is
based upon the useful Zaval JRC Editor written by Victor Krapivin and
others (<u>http://www.zaval.org/products/jrc-editor/</u>).</P>

<P>The localization tool arranges translation keys hierarchically and
displays the resulting tree on the left.  Exclamation points indicate
keys that still need to be translated.  When you select a key in this
tree, the right hand side of the screen displays the English message
and a place for translation into your native language.</P>

<p><center><img src="../../Images/LocalizationTool.png"></center></p>

<P>Some translation keys end with the string "_FMT".  The English
message associated with these keys will contain expressions like
"{0}".  These translation items are Java MessageFormat strings; at
runtime, the "{0}" will be replaced with a dynamically generated
value.  To translate these items correctly, you will need to
understand the syntax of MessageFormat strings.  For more information
on MessageFormat syntax, visit
<u>http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/api/java/text/MessageFormat.html</u></P>

<P>After you enter translations, click on the Save icon.  Your new
translations will take effect the next time you restart the process
dashboard.</P>

<P>The localizations you enter will be saved automatically into a file
with a name like "pspdash_*.jar".  This file will be saved into the
directory where you installed the process dashboard (normally
<u>C:\Program&nbsp;Files\Process&nbsp;Dashboard</u> for Windows
users).  This file is formatted as a
<a href="../Overview/HowToInstall.html#addon">Process Dashboard Add-on</a>,
and can be easily shared with other dashboard users.  Give them a copy
of the file and instruct them to save it into the directory where they
installed the Process Dashboard, and they can benefit from your
translations as well.</P>

<P>If you choose to use the Localization Tool, please consider sending
a copy of your "pspdash_*.jar" file to the Process Dashboard
development team.  This will allow users around the world to benefit
from your translation efforts.</P>

<P><b>Note:</b> <a href="../Overview/Separation.html">copyright
restrictions</a> do not allow for the translation of PSP process
materials (e.g. scripts and forms) into other languages.  As a result,
the Localization Tool does not support the translation of these items.</P>
