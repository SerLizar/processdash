<h1>Create Quality Plan</h1>
<b>(TSP Launch Meeting No. 5)</b>

<p>Because of the way the dashboard currently handles team quality
data, it is necessary to create individual team member plans before
you can view the team quality plan. (See the section above for more
information on creating individual team member plans.) This means that
you should most likely alter the launch schedule, folding launch
meeting No. 6 back into launch meeting No.4.</p>

<p>Once you have successfully validated the bottom-up team plan, you
may proceed with the steps below.</p>

<ol>

<li>Team quality metrics are calculated using team project quality
parameters. These parameters can be edited on the Team Project
Parameters and Settings page, which can be opened from the script menu
for the team project.

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/team-settings-page.png"></p>

<p>This page includes:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>An Estimated Phase Yields section for entering the yields your
    team plans to achieve in each quality phase.</li>

    <li>An Estimated Defect Injection Rates section for entering
    estimated project defect injection rates.</li>

    </ul>

<p>Follow the guidance provided in the TSP process to create these
estimates.</p></li>


<li>Using the quality parameters entered on the page above, and data
from your team's project plan, the dashboard will calculate a quality
plan for your project, and include it as part of the overall project
plan. To view this quality plan, switch to the Team Dashboard window,
click the down-arrow to the right of the script button to display the
drop-down menu, find the submenu corresponding to the overall project,
and select the Project Summary option. The project plan summary will
appear in your web browser.

<p>The process mentor for your organization will have populated your
project summary with charts, forms, and reports that you can use to
view the planned quality metrics. (See the section above, entitled
&quot;Creating Forms for Organizational Use.&quot;)</p>

<p>You can drill down and see the quality plans for various project
subcomponents by clicking on the (<img

<li>If the calculated quality metrics do not meet your team's quality
goals, you may edit the project quality parameters described in step 1
above, in keeping with the guidance in the TSP process. To simplify
this task, open two browser windows: one containing the project
parameters page, and the other containing the calculated quality
plan. As you edit the quality parameters, calculated values (displayed
as numbers in grey boxes) will recalculate automatically. To update
views of graphical charts, you will need to refresh the page
manually.</li>

</ol>
