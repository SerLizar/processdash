<h1>Create Team Data Directory (Team Leader)</h1>

<p>The team support add-on for the Process Dashboard currently uses a
shared network directory to facilitate team collaboration.  Before you
begin your first team project, it will be necessary to create this
directory. <b>Note:</b> this &quot;Team Data Directory&quot; can be
the same as the team configuration directory that you selected during
team dashboard installation, or it can be different - either is
allowed.</b></p>

<p>The primary purpose of this directory is to hold exported snapshots
of individual data; the team dashboard instance imports this data and
uses it to compute rolled-up team data. The <i>team directory</i> must
be accessible, readable, and writable by all team members.  Because of
this, it should generally be a shared network directory. Since the
directory will hold PSP data collected by individuals, you may wish to
configure it with permissions that forbid file access by non-team
members.</p>

<p>Any number of projects can share the same team directory; the
Process Dashboard will still be able to track which data belongs to
which project. Thus, if your team is performing several projects (or
project iterations) one after another, it is not necessary to create a
new team directory for each project/iteration.</p>

<p>Many projects will already have a shared network directory that is
used to hold project documents. If this is true for your project,
simply create a subdirectory for dashboard metrics data.  If your
project does not already have a shared project directory, work with
your information technology (IT) support staff to create one. Either
way, it is critical to ensure that the following file permissions are
in place:</p>

<ul>

<li>All team members must be able to read/write all files</li>

<li>Permissions must be set to "inherit" - so that when new files and
subdirectories are created, all team members can read/write them as
well.</li>

</ul>
