<h2>Step 6: Testing the program</h2>

<P>The testing phase is another phase that typically finds many defects.  
Since we have already seen an entry of a defect, we will take this 
opportunity to look at a more complicated situation.</p>

<P>Consider the following circumstance: you find a defect and put in a fix.  
Upon compiling your fix you discover that you have inadvertantly injected 
another defect (perhaps a syntax error in your coding).  This is what the PSP 
calls a "fix defect" -- a defect injected while entering a fix for another 
defect.</p>

<P>The dashboard has a very handy feature to help in this regard.  While the 
defect dialog for one defect is open, you can click on the little defect 
button in the corner to enter a new defect for the fix of the current 
defect.</p>

<P>After clicking the Fix Defect button, a new defect dialog will open for 
entry of data for this new defect.</p>

<p><img src="../../Images/QSTwoDefectDialogs.jpg"></p>

<P>While this new defect dialog is open, the timer for the previous defect 
dialog is paused.  Also, notice that the number of the previous defect is 
already entered in the Fix Defect blank.  Once the information for this new 
defect is entered and the user clicks OK, the previous defect dialog will pop 
to the front of the screen and the timer will resume.  For more information 
about this behavior, see the <a 
href="../Execution/EnteringDefects.html">Entering Defects</a> help topic.</p>

<P>Back to our example.  Once the program has been sufficiently tested and 
all the defects have been entered, hit the completion button again to move 
into Postmortem.</p>
