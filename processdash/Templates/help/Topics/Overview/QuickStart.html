<p>This "Quick Start" example is provided to illustrate the most
commonly used features in the Process Dashboard, and walk you through
their use on a typical project.  PSP2.1 is used for this example,
because most PSP-trained engineers will choose to use PSP2.1 for their
daily work.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: In order to use PSP2.1 (and PROBE in particular) you 
<B>must</B> have historical data. When you first begin using the dashboard, 
you won't have any historical data in the dashboard. Therefore:

<UL>
 <LI>If you have been using PSP for some time, you may be able to use the 
   &quot;PSP Data Import&quot; add-on process set (available for download 
   from <u class="url">http://processdash.sourceforge.net</U>) to enter
   your historical data into the dashboard.</LI>
 <LI>If you have never used PSP before, you should use the PSP0 process for 
   your first project, and the PSP0.1 process for your second and third 
   projects. You should also take a PSP course to learn how to use the PSP 
   processes.</LI>
</UL>
