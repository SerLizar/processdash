<H1>Quick start example: a PSP1.1 project</H1>
<P>This example will show how to use the Process Dashboard for a PSP1.1 level 
software project.  The example that will be followed is program 5A from the 
book <I>A Discipline for Software Engineering</I> by Watts Humphrey.  This 
program was chosen because it will show nearly all of the features that the 
Process Dashboard currently offers without being overly complicated<A
HREF="#note">*</A>.</P> 

<P>Here are the steps that we will take in this example:</P>

<A NAME="note">*</A><B>Note</B>: This example demonstrates PSP1.1 only 
because it shows many features of the Process Dashboard. You should realize, 
however, that in order to use PSP1.1 (and PROBE in particular) you 
<B>must</B> have historical data. When you first begin using the dashboard, 
you won't have any historical data in the dashboard. Therefore:

<UL>
 <LI>If you have been using PSP for some time, you may be able to use the 
   &quot;PSP Data Import&quot; add-on process set (available for download 
   from <U>http://processdash.sourceforge.net</U>) to enter your historical 
   data into the dashboard.</LI>
 <LI> If you have never used PSP before, you should use the PSP0 process for 
   your first project, and the PSP0.1 process for your second and third 
   projects. You should also take a PSP course to learn how to use the PSP 
   processes.</LI>
