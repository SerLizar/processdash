<h2>Step 5: Compiling the program</h2>

<P>While compiling the program, many people will find that they have injected 
a defect during the previous phases.  Such was the case for this program as 
well.</p>

<P>To enter a defect, click the defect button.</P>

<P>The first defect found by the student on this program was due to a syntax 
error.  The defect dialog looks for this defect looks like the following:</p>

<p><img src="../../Images/QSEnterDefect1.jpg"></p>

<P>The defect dialog allows entry of all the pertinent data about a defect.  
For more information about entering defects into the dashboard, see the <a 
href="../Execution/EnteringDefects.html">Entering Defects</a> help topic.</p> 

<p>Of course, there were more defects found during compile, but we won't show 
them all.</p>

<P>Once all the defects that were found in compile have been entered and the 
program compiles cleanly, clicking the completion button moves us onward into 
the testing phase.</p>
