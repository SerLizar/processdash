<h2>Step 2: Planning the project</h2>

<P>Now that the project exists, we can start the planning of our work.  The 
PSP provides scripts for planning, development, postmortem work, etc., so 
let's go look at the planning script for our new PSP1.1 project.  This is done 
by selecting our newly created project via the hierarchy menus (the dashboard 
will automatically select the planning phase -- the first development phase 
of a PSP1.1 project), then clicking the scripts button.  We should also click 
the play button on the dashboard to start timing our planning activities.  
When the play button is pressed, a quiet "clicking" sound will be heard.  
This sound will be heard anytime the dashboard switches phases of activity 
while the clock is running.</p>

<P><center><img src="../../Images/QSChoosingPlanning.png"></center></p>

<P>The dashboard responds by bringing up the PSP1.1 planning script in a web 
browser.  Reading through the script, we see that once we understand the 
requirements for program 5A, we need to do a size estimate.  To guide our 
estimation, we can use the PROBE method.  Following the <U>PROBE method</u> 
link on the planning script brings up the PROBE Estimating Script.</p>

<p>Reading through this script we see that once we have produced a conceptual 
design, we need to fill out the Size Estimating Template.  The dashboard 
provides both the template itself an the instruction script for its use.  
Following the link for the <U>Size Estimating Template</u> brings up a 
dynamic HTML version of the template.  For ready reference, the template has 
a link near the top to display the Size Estimating Template instructions 
form.  If you click on this link, a second browser will be started so that 
you can have the instructions and the template side by side on your screen.  
For more information on the Size Estimating Template, see the <a 
href="../Planning/UsingSizeEstimatingTemplate.html">Size Estimating 
Template</a> help topic.</p>

<p><center><img src="../../Images/QSShowSizeEstimatingTemplateTop.png"></center></p>

<P>The Size Estimating Template Instructions direct us to count the base LOC 
and enter it at entry B if this is an enhancement of a previous program.  
Program 5A is a new program, so the whole base program LOC and base additions 
sections don't apply.  We will leave those entries with their default values 
of 0.</p>

<P>New objects will be a place for most of our estimating.  The student who 
produced the data used for this example estimated 5 new objects would be 
created.  Their types, number of methods, and LOC estimates are entered under 
the new objects section of the form.  The "add more rows for new objects" 
link will expand the form with more entries if chosen.</p>

<P>The student who worked this problem did not have any entries for the 
reused objects section of the form, so we will skip that section as well.</P>

<P>Moving on to the size calculation, we need to calculate the estimated new 
&amp; changed LOC via the PROBE tool.  The PROBE tool is accessed from the 
"C" menu.</P>

<p><center><img src="../../Images/QSProbeBefore.png"></center></p>

<P>The PROBE script gives several ways to calculate an estimate.  We would 
like to know if we can use linear regression, i.e. do our data correlate 
well?  The PROBE tool can tell us at a glance. The top pulldown control has 
all the standard PROBE methods available.  When it first appears, the PROBE 
dialog has already chosen "PROBE Method A for Size", and we can see already 
that our data do not correlate by the r<sup>2</sup> and p values shown in 
red.  That makes sense, since method A requires historical data for estimated 
object LOC, which we don't have by the time we do Program 5A. We can quickly 
check the other PROBE methods just by choosing a method in the pulldown.</p>

<P>When we try method B, the numbers don't look much better, so we're forced
to use method C.  The dashboard provides two method C's for size: C1 and C2.  
These are very analogous to the different C methods that are available in the 
standard PSP estimating procedure for Time estimation.  C1 needs to have 
historical data for estimated object LOC, so that won't be usable.  We will 
use C2.</p>

<P>The right hand column of numbers shows data for method C2, the averaging 
method.  It has already set <i>B</i><sub>0</sub> to 0.0, and has done the 
calculation of <i>B</i><sub>1</sub> for you.</p>

<P>Moving forward with method C2, we need to enter our estimated object LOC 
from the Size Estimating Template into the PROBE tool.  Entering 164.3 into 
the estimate blank gives us the following screen.</p>

<p><center><img src="../../Images/QSProbeAfter.png"></center></p>

<P>Our projected New &amp; Changed LOC for this project should be 120.39.  We 
can also record the values of <i>B</i><sub>0</sub> and <i>B</i><sub>1</sub>, 
the Prediction Interval percent (70%), and the method chosen (C2) on the Size 
Estimating Template form under the Size heading.  The other values requested 
on the form (prediction range, UPI, LPI, and r<sup>2</sup>) don't apply to 
method C2 since they are by-products of a regression fit.  We can leave them 
as they are.</p>

<P>We can now use the PROBE tool to attempt a correlation between Estimated New 
&amp; Changed LOC and total development time.  Again, we can investigate the 
different methods to see if our data correlates.  Again, our data does not 
correlate well enough to use methods A or B, so we are left with the C 
methods.  C2 is the correct choice again because we don't have estimates of 
object LOC to use as a basis.</p>

<p><center><img src="../../Images/QSProbeAfterTime.png"></center></p>

<P>Our projected Time estimated for this project should be 337.69 minutes.  
We record this value as well as the other values as before 
(<i>B</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>B</i><sub>1</sub>, prediction interval, and probe 
method).  And again, we can skip the linear regression parameters.</p> 

<p>After our planning efforts on this form it looks like the following:</p>

<p><center><img src="../../Images/QSSizeEstimatingTemplateDone.png"></center></p>

<P>When we bring up the Project Plan Summary, we see that the planning data 
is all entered automatically.  Time to click the little done button on the 
dashboard and move on into design!</p>

<p><center><img src="../../Images/QSFinishPlanning.png"></center></p>

<P>Note also that when the dashboard moves into a new phase while the timer 
is running, a little "clicking" noise is made.  This little bit of feedback 
assures us that the timer is still running.</p>
