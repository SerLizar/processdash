<h1>Enter List of Team Members</h1>

<b>(TSP Launch Meeting No. 2)</b>

<p>The dashboard needs a list of project team members to facilitate
planning later in the launch. If you wish, you may enter this data
before the launch begins; otherwise, you can enter this information
during the launch. The list of team members can be edited at any
time.</p>

<p>In the script menu for the team project, choose the Edit Team
Member List option.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/team-scripts-teamlist.png"></p>

<p>The Team List Editor will appear.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/team-list.png"></p>

<p>Using one line per team member, enter the following required information:

    <ul style='margin-bottom:9pt'>

    <li style='margin-top:9pt'>Enter the team member's full name in
    the first column.</li>

    <li style='margin-top:9pt'>Enter the team member's initials in
    the second column. These initials should correspond to the values
    the person provided when they joined the team project.  Within
    this project, no two individuals should have the same initials. If you
    happen to have two people on your project with the same initials,
    have one select a different string of letters.</li>

    <li style='margin-top:9pt'>The color in the third column will be
    used later to quickly distinguish between individuals. If you
    decide to change the default color provided for an individual, try
    to ensure that the final list is comprised of mutually dissimilar
    colors. Also, avoid using the color red, as it is used to indicate
    unusual/error conditions.</li>

    <li style='margin-top:9pt'>In the fourth column, enter the
    approximate number of hours each team member plans to spend per
    week on productive project work.</li>

    <li style='margin-top:9pt'>The remaining columns allow you to
    enter the schedule details for each individual:

      <ul>

      <li style='margin-top:9pt'>If an individual will be starting the
      project later than the rest of the team, click and drag the
      "START" indicator. <i>(Example: in the image above, Chris White
      will not start working on the project until 9/21.)</i>
      Alternatively, you can enter "0" for that individual in the
      first few weeks of the schedule.</li>

      <li style='margin-top:9pt'>Each week in the schedule will show
      the default number of hours per week that were entered in column
      4.  If an individual has an exception - for example, due to
      vacation or training - enter the exception in the appropriate
      column.  <i>(Example: in the image above, Jane Smith will be
      away from the office during the week of 9/28 - 10/5.)</i></li>

      <li style='margin-top:9pt'><a name="endDate"></a>In certain
      unusual circumstances, you may know that an individual will be
      leaving the project on a particular date. (For example, they may
      be leaving to work on a different project.) To set an end date
      for a particular individual, put your mouse over the handle on
      the far right edge of the table, and drag it to the left.
      <i>(Example: in the image above, Jill Hsu will be leaving the
      project on 10/5.)</i> If you do this by mistake, you can cancel
      the end date by dragging the "END" indicator all the way to the
      right edge of the table.  <b>Please note:</b> the "END" date
      should <b>not</b> be used to record the date you hope the project
      will finish; <a href="PlanProjectStrategy.html#milestones">milestone
      commit dates</a> are more appropriate for that purpose.</li>

      <li style='margin-top:9pt'>To view different weeks on the calendar,
      click the large left/right arrow buttons that appear in the date
      header.  You can also resize the window to see more weeks at one
      time.</li>

      </ul>

    </ul>

<p>If you need to delete an entry from the list, simply delete the name
and initials for that row. When you save and reopen the team list,
that row will be automatically removed.</p>

<p>You can change the order of the individuals in the team member list by
highlighting a row, then dragging it up or down.  In addition, if your team
is beginning a new project or new iteration, you can use Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V
to copy highlighted team member rows from one Team Member list window to
another.</p>


<p>Click the Save button when you are finished editing the list of
team members.</p>
