/**
 * This factory establishes a reusable pattern for running code that might not
 * be supported in a particular java runtime environment.
 * 
 * A case in point: our application makes use of certain APIs that are only
 * found in Java 1.6. However, it is crucial that our application continue to
 * run without errors in a Java 1.5 environment. Thus, any time we wish to use a
 * Java 1.6 API, we must approach our usage carefully, following these steps:
 * 
 * <ol>
 * 
 * <li>Collect the code that is using the Java 1.6 API, and place it in a
 * separate class. This class must have a no-arg constructor. That constructor
 * must perform various tests to ensure that the current runtime environment
 * meets its needs. If the runtime environment is missing any of the needed
 * APIs, the constructor <b>must</b> throw an exception.</li>
 * 
 * <li>Define an <tt>interface</tt> that you will use to interact with the
 * class above. This interface must compile cleanly against the Java 1.5 APIs.
 * Make the class above <tt>implement</tt> this interface.</li>
 * 
 * <li>If possible/applicable, define a class that runs under Java 1.5, and
 * performs some subset of the functionality provided by the class you created
 * in step 1. If the appropriate action to take in Java 1.5 is to "do nothing",
 * then it is not necessary to create this class.</li>
 * 
 * </ol>
 * 
 * Then, to interact with this functionality, use a code snippet like the
 * following:
 * 
 * <pre>MyInterface xyz =
 *     new FallbackObjectFactory&lt;MyInterface&gt;(MyInterface.class)
 *             .add("class.name.of.FirstChoiceImplementation")
 *             .add("class.name.of.SecondChoiceImplementation")
 *             .add("....") // as many of these as you need - only 1 is required
 *             .get();
 * // now invoke methods on xyz as necessary
 * xyz.doSomething(args);</pre>
 * 
 * This factory will attempt to create an object of the specified types.  If
 * none of the named classes could be supported in the current java runtime
 * environment, this factory will return an object which implements your
 * interface and does nothing.
 * 
 * Although our primary usage of this class will be graceful degradation in
 * Java 1.5, it can be used for other purposes as well.  For example, this
 * could be used to detect whether the user had JavaHelp installed, and
 * gracefully degrade to an alternative context-sensitive help implementation.
 * Any time we want to provide advanced functionality that gracefully degrades
 * in a less-capable runtime environment, this class is appropriate.
 * 
 * 
 * @param <I> the interface or class that will be implemented/extended by
 *    objects returned from this factory.
 * @see RuntimeUtils#assertMethod(Class, String)
 *
