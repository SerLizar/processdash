<H1>Overall goals</H1>
<P>We feel that the PSP and the TSP are remarkable technologies that can change 
the face of the software industry, and we share the SEI's zeal to promote their 
widespread use. We feel that a freely available, powerful support tool could 
help to remove one of the most significant barriers to PSP / TSP adoption. We 
therefore aim to develop a world-class tool under the open-source model, and 
distribute it freely to anyone using the PSP and/or TSP. We feel that this is 
the least we can do to thank the SEI for developing and distributing these 
remarkable processes. </P>

<a name="psp"></a><H2>What is the PSP<SUP>(SM)</SUP>?</H2>
<P>The Personal Software Process<SUP>(SM)</SUP>, created by Watts Humprey of 
the Software Engineering Institute, introduces software engineers to a 
disciplined process for software engineering. Engineers using the PSP to 
develop software follow defined processes and collect detailed metrics on the 
time required to produce a product, the defects that were injected and 
removed at various stages in development, and the size of the finished 
product.</P>

<P>These metrics are then analyzed using statistical methods, enabling 
engineers to produce highly accurate estimates based on historical data, 
track progress and quality of a project in progress, predict schedule 
impacts, and predict the quality of a finished software product. The PSP 
encourages engineers to quantitatively determine ways to improve their 
process.</P>

<P>For more information on the PSP, see the official PSP website at 
<U>http://www.sei.cmu.edu/tsp</u>, maintained by Carnegie Mellon 
University.</P>

<a name="tsp"></a><H2>What is the TSP<SUP>(SM)</SUP>?</H2>
<P>The Team Software Process<SUP>(SM)</SUP>, also created by Watts Humphrey, 
is a process framework for teams of PSP-trained engineers. The TSP scales 
well and can be used by teams of 3 to 20 people to develop software products 
of significant size and complexity.</P>

<P>Teams of engineers using both the PSP and the TSP to develop software have 
consistently observed remarkable improvements in their work:</P>

<UL>
 <LI>End-to-end productivity improvements of 20% - 150%</li>
 <LI>99% reductions in system test defects, and virtually defect-free 
   released software.</li>
 <LI>Schedule estimates accurate to within 10% (4% error on average)</LI>
</UL>

<H2>Why build a tool?</H2>
<P>Both the PSP and the TSP require the collection and analysis of metrics at 
a <I>very</I> fine-grained level. Further, TSP requires teams to roll-up 
individual metrics to produce team metrics. Once data are collected at this 
level, statistical analyses of the data permit remarkable planning, tracking, 
prediction, and control of software products and projects.</P>

<P>These metrics collection and analysis processes, however, are not trivial. 
In any real-world project, tool support for the PSP and TSP become important 
considerations. Although studies have demonstrated that people <U>can</U> 
maintain their productivity when using the PSP <I>without</I> tool support, 
the "frustration factor" inherent with such an approach tries the patience of 
all but the most disciplined engineers, making PSP behaviors difficult to 
sustain.</P>

<P>Ideally, PSP/TSP practitioners would like to have a support tool that:</P>

<UL>
 <LI>Allows data at the personal level to be collected quickly and easily, 
   with minimal frustration.</li>
 <LI>Can be integrated with existing development environments and project 
   management tools.</li>
 <LI>Allows individuals to collaborate on the execution of a process (even if 
   they are geographically distributed).</li>
 <LI>Allows data at the individual level to be rolled up to produce 
   team-level or organizational-level metrics.</li>
 <LI>Protects the privacy of individuals, and prevents unauthorized people 
   from seeing or using their data.</li>
 <LI>Supports powerful analyses of data at the individual, team, 
   organizational, and enterprise levels, and allows existing (external) 
   applications to access the data (while still maintaining the security 
   mentioned above).</li>
 <LI>Supports arbitrary processes (including processes that have yet to be 
   written), and arbitrary new process tools.</LI>
</UL>

<P>This initiative aims to develop an open-source tool to meet all of these 
needs.</P>

<P>Development on the dashboard is ongoing. To see the list of features 
currently supported / being worked on, select the "Coming Soon" link on our
