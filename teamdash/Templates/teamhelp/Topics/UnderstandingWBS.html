<h1>Understanding the Role of the Work Breakdown Structure</h1>

<p>Stepping back from the details for a moment, it is very important
to understand the relationship between the Work Breakdown Structure
and the rest of your team project.</p>

<p>As any TSP practitioner knows, the project launch meetings used in
the Team Software Process are <i>very</i> intense planning
sessions. This allows them to produce extremely powerful team plans;
but since your entire team is present, these meetings are relatively
expensive from a business standpoint. Recognizing this, the Process
Dashboard team wanted to provide the best possible tool support to
facilitate these meetings. The WBS Editor is specifically designed to
meet this need. Everything about its design and user interface is
streamlined to facilitate the unique planning needs of a project
launch - enabling you to create the highest-quality team plan, while
minimizing the time required and eliminating frustrations whenever
possible.</p>

<p>For example, the contents of the WBS are edited
&quot;offline,&quot; in a mode that is completely disconnected with
the data in regular dashboard instances. This offline approach allows
dramatic changes to be made to the hierarchy of the WBS quickly,
without waiting for those changes to be applied to an entire database
of existing project metrics. (The tradeoff, of course, is that
individuals must occasionally use the &quot;Sync to WBS&quot; buttons
to copy project planning metrics to their personal dashboard.)</p>

<p>However, it is also important to realize that &quot;Sync to
WBS&quot; operations are one-way. Data is copied from the WBS to
individual dashboard instances, but no data ever flows in the opposite
direction. As a result, the estimates in the WBS will quickly become
out-of-date.&nbsp; You can refer to the WBS in the future if you're
curious about your original baseline.&nbsp; Also, you can use it to
add new features, or reassign tasks.&nbsp; But it is not kept in sync
with changes made elsewhere, and thus is not designed to be an ongoing
tracking tool. For ongoing tracking, the Team Project Planning Summary
is designed to show you accurate, up-to-date project metrics.</p>
