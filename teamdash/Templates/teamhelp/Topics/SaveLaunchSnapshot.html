<h1>Save Backup of Project Data</h1>

<p>At the conclusion of your team project launch, you should save a
data backup of the team dashboard. From the main Team Dashboard window,
choose File&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Save Data Backup.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/team-save-data-backup.png"></p>

<p>This will save a ZIP file with a snapshot of all the data for all of the
team projects in your Team Dashboard.  You can use the Process Dashboard
Quick Launcher to open this backup at any time in the future, and view all
reports exactly as they appeared when the backup was made.</p>

<p>It is also a good idea to save a data backup each week during your
project. This provides a useful history of your project's
progress.</p>

<h2>Submitting Data to the SEI</h2>

<p>At the end of their launch, licensed users of the Team Software
Process are required to submit their data to the Software Engineering
Institute.  The SEI uses this data to perform research into the
benefits of the TSP.</p>

<p>To comply with this requirements, teams are encouraged to use the "Save
Data Backup" feature, then send the resulting ZIP file to the SEI.  If your
company is concerned about releasing proprietary information in this
backup, you might consider saving the backup in "Redacted" format and
choosing to scramble the types of data (e.g. task names, names of
individuals, etc) that you deem to be sensitive.</p>

<p>If you have created your own <a href="MetricsCollectionFramework.html">custom
metrics collection framework</a>, you will need to include a copy of that
framework (which is also a ZIP file) along with your data submission.</p>


<h2>Creating HTML Snapshots</h2>

<p>At times, you may need to share a copy of your plan with a manager or
other stakeholder who does not have the Dashboard Quick Launcher installed.
For this purpose, a second export mechanism is provided that saves a
non-interactive copy of the team project plan summary report.  To
accomplish this, open the team dashboard, select the team project from the
tree on the left, and choose Team Project Tools from the list on the right.
When the Team Project Tools page appears, click the "Save Snapshot of
Project Plan" button.  This will save a static snapshot of the web pages
that make up the team project plan summary report.  You can choose to save
the file in various formats, which can be viewed later in programs such as
Internet Explorer.</p>
