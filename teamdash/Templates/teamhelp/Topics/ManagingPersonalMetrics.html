<h1>Managing Process Metrics (Team Member)</h1>

<p>The Process Dashboard performs many calculations that help you
track your progress and monitor the quality of the products you and
your team produce. To calculate these metrics, the dashboard needs you
to collect and enter some additional data.</p>

<h2>Entering Defects</h2>

<ol>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>As you create documents, designs, and
code, you should keep track of the defects you discover and remove
from the software. To enter a defect, switch to the Process Dashboard
window, use the Hierarchy Menus to navigate to the component
containing the defect, and click the Defect button (<img
src="../Images/icon-defect.png">). A defect dialog will appear,
allowing you to describe the defect. A timer in the defect dialog
makes it possible to track the amount of time it takes to fix the
defect. (For additional information on entering defects, press F1 to
open the Process Dashboard Users Manual.)</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'><b>Reviews:</b> If you find defects
while personally reviewing a product that you created, enter the
defect normally using the defect dialog, as described above.</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'><b>Inspections/Peer
Reviews: </b>During the course of your project, you will often review products
created by other team members. In these situations, it is very common for
several people to find the same defect. If you were to enter these defects
using the method described above, the dashboard would not be able to recognize
the duplicated defects, and the defect would get counted twice. Because of
this, defects found during inspections should be handled differently:

    <ul>

    <li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>Obtain a blank inspection form (your
    team should have a defined form explicitly for this purpose). As
    you review the product, make a note of each defect you find on the
    inspection form. (Of course, you should also be using the
    dashboard to track the time you spend reviewing the
    material.)</li>

    <li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>After you complete your review, it
    is common to have a meeting where you discuss the defects you
    found with other reviewers, and with the author of the product
    being reviewed. Take your completed inspection form with you to
    this meeting, so the scribe can create a consolidated list of all
    defects found. (If your team inspection process does not include
    such a meeting, you should instead send your list of defects to
    the author of the reviewed product. The author will be responsible
    for creating the consolidated list of defects.)</li>

    <li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>Once the author has a consolidated
    list of defects, they typically correct each defect found. As the
    author works through the list of defects, he or she should enter
    the defects into the dashboard using the method described above,
    and use the defect dialog to track the amount of time it takes to
    fix each defect. Some items found during the inspection may
    actually be more than one defect, and if so should be entered
    accordingly.</li>

    </ul>

<p>Your team should have a defined process for performing an
inspection, which you should follow even if it differs from the steps
described above. The person responsible for fixing the defects found
should also enter the defect data into the dashboard.</p></li>

</ol>


<h2>Entering Size Data</h2>

<ol>

<li>You should use a PSP process (like PSP2.1) to develop code in
support of your team project. As you complete a particular component,
you should count the new and changed lines of code and enter them in
the PSP Plan Summary form, as described in the Postmortem script for
the PSP process you are using.</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>During your project you may create many
types of documents (for example, requirements documents, design
documents, or users manuals). As you create such documents you should
record their actual finished size in the dashboard.  To do this,
navigate to the team project using the dashboard Hierarchy Menus, and
click the down arrow to the right of the Script button. From the popup
menu that appears, choose the Size Inventory form from the submenu
corresponding to the overall project.

<p class="figure"><img
   src="../Images/indiv-dash-scriptmenu-size-inventory.png"></p>

<p>The Size Inventory form will be displayed in your Web browser.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/indiv-size-inventory.png"></p>

<p>Some entries will probably already appear in your size inventory;
when you synchronized your work breakdown structure, this information
was copied from the team plan. If you find an existing entry for a
document you have created, you can enter a description of the
document, along with the actual finished size of the document. If the
size changes due to edits in the future, you can return to this form
and alter the actual size value.</p>

<p>You can also create new entries in this size inventory form using
the hyperlinks that appear at the bottom of the page. Make certain to
enter a description, choose the appropriate size units, and enter
planned and actual sizes for each new entry.</p>

<p>You will note that the Size Units field includes options for
various types of documents. If you create a document, you should pick
the size metric that best describes that document. In the Actual
field, enter the number of pages that you personally wrote. If several
people wrote sections of a particular document, each person should
make an entry in their Size Inventory form describing the sections
that they wrote and the sizes of those sections. (You can use the
Description field to describe the specific section of the document
that you wrote.)  Only enter a value in the Actual field describing
portions of the document that <i>you</i> produced - do not enter
values describing document pages written by other team members.</p>

<p>You will find that the Size Units field also includes options that
begin with the word Inspected (for example, Inspected SRS Pages or
Inspected LOC). If you participate in an inspection, you may select
one of these options to record the size of the product you
inspected.</p></li>

</ol>

<h2>Reviewing Project Metrics</h2>

<p>Project planning summary reports are available for all of the work
you do on your project. You can open these plan summaries by clicking
the drop-down arrow to the right of the dashboard Script button.</p>

<p>PSP tasks in your project hierarchy will provide familiar project
plan summary forms, as defined by the PSP process. For other types of
tasks in your project hierarchy, a special hierarchical plan summary
form is provided.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/indiv-plan-summary.png"></p>

<p>You can expand and contract the time and defect portion of the plan
summary form to display the data for a relevant cross-section of the
project. Alternatively, you can drill down into a different part of
your project hierarchy by clicking on the (<img
src="../Images/icon-hier-nav.png">) icon.</p>
