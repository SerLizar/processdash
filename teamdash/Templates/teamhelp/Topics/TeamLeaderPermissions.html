<h1>Managing Permissions and Privacy</h1>

<p>The reports and tools in the Team Dashboard are designed to support
self-directed teams, and to strike a balance between openness and data
privacy.  For many teams, the default settings work very well.  But when
projects become larger, and when you are required to share data with people
outside the team, you may find it useful to control who can see and edit
certain types of data.  The Team Dashboard includes a role-based access
framework for this purpose.</p>



<h2><a name="roles"></a>Editing Roles</h2>

<p>Roles represent a set of responsibilities and permissions that can be
granted to individuals.  To edit roles, choose "Edit Roles" from the "Tools"
menu on the main Team Dashboard window.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/team-tools-roles.png"></p>

<p>This will open a window for editing roles:</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/team-edit-roles.png"></p>

<p>Roles can be added, duplicated, renamed, and deleted using the buttons
above the list.</p>

<p><a name="addPerm"></a>With a role highlighted, you can add and delete
permissions for the role using the buttons on the right. Clicking the Add
button displays a list of available permissions:</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/team-edit-roles-add-permission.png"></p>

<p>Permissions are hierarchical. When you select a permission to add, its
children are given a light blue highlight as a visual clue that they will be
implicitly granted too. If desired, you can select "All Dashboard Permissions"
to grant all permissions to a coach, team lead, or other role.</p>

<p>Most permissions are either granted or not; but some permissions have extra
parameters. If you add a parameterizable permission, you will see an extra
prompt to configure the value of the parameter:</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/team-edit-roles-perm-param.png"></p>

<p>After adding one of these parameterizable permissions, you can change the
value of the parameter by highlighting it in the roles window and clicking the
Edit button.</p>

<p>If you have been editing a role and you make a mistake, you can click the
Revert button. This replaces the list of permissions for this role with the
values that were in place before you opened the Roles Editor.</p>

<p>When you are finished with your edits, you can save them by clicking OK. If
you click Cancel, your edits will be discarded.</p>



<h2><a name="users"></a>Editing Users</h2>

<p>After roles have been defined, you can assign these roles to users by
choosing "Edit Users" from the Team Dashboard "Tools" menu.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/team-tools-users.png"></p>

<p>This opens a window for editing the list of users:</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/team-edit-users.png"></p>

<p>This window provides elements to search for users, to toggle the display of
inactive users, to add and delete users, and to view/edit a table of details
for each user.  Clicking OK saves your changes, clicking Cancel discards
them.</p>

<p>The "Active?" column determines whether an individual will be allowed to
open the Team Dashboard.  Removing the checkmark will disallow the given user
from opening the Team Dashboard.</p>

<p>The Roles column in the table allows you to choose the roles that should be
assigned to a user.  A given user can have more than one role; just separate
the role names with commas.  Users will receive all of the permissions of all
the roles they have been granted.  Is is also permissable not to assign any
role at all, which would leave a user with the most limited privileges
possible.</p>

<p>The table header for the Roles column includes a "help" icon. If you click
this icon, a role definition report will be displayed in your web browser.
This report displays all of the roles that have been defined, along with the
permissions they contain; this can be helpful for deciding which roles a given
user should be granted.</p>

<p>The first row of the table sets permissions for people whose usernames are
not explicitly listed.  Clearing the "Active" checkmark will prevent unlisted
people from opening this Team Dashboard.  Leaving the row "Active" and
assigning zero or more roles will allow unlisted people to open this Team
Dashboard, but be constrained by the permissions of the associated roles.</p>

<p>When you highlight a particular user, you can click the "View" button to
see the effective list of permissions that user has been granted, as a result
of their assigned role or roles:</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/team-edit-users-view.png"></p>

<p>Permission grants are enforced equally when someone opens a Team Dashboard
<a href="TeamLeaderData.html#quickLauncher">data backup</a> in the Quick
Launcher.  As a result, you can prevent unlisted people from opening your
team's data backups, or you can control the types of data they are able to
see.  This means that you should consider external people (like remote
coaches) when you are listing users and configuring permissions.</p>


<h2>Permission Grant Latency</h2>

<p>If you make changes that affect your own permissions in the WBS Editor,
these permissions will not take effect until you close and reopen the WBS
Editor.</p>

<p>For most Team-Dashboard-related permissions, you can make a change to
users/roles and see the change right away. The exceptions are the permissions
for editing users and roles. If you make a change that would remove your own
ability to edit users/roles, the change will not be applied until you close
and reopen the Team Dashboard. This gives you a "grace period" to recover from
mistakes. If you do edit away your ability to change users/roles, a warning
will be displayed:</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/team-edit-perms-loss-warning.png"></p>



<h2><a name="privacy"></a>Data Privacy</h2>

<p>Many of the available permissions control whether a person is allowed to do
something, or whether they are allowed to edit a particular type of data. But
another class of permissions relates to data privacy.</p>

<p>Data privacy is an extremely important consideration for TSP teams, because
the data that individuals collect is very sensitive. The data provides
excellent opportunities for project management and process improvement, but
can be dangerous if misused.</p>

<h3>Data Privacy Considerations</h3>

<p>The following drivers underscore the need for effective data privacy:</p>

<p><b>The desires of the individual</b> - the individuals who are collecting
and sharing their data have specific expectations about who will be allowed
see it, and how it will be used.  To the greatest extent possible, we strive
to honor these expectations. We also strive to provide transparency to users
about who can see their data, to inspire trust.</p>

<p><b>Laws and regulations</b> - data privacy laws govern the use of data
collected by individuals in the EU.</p>

<p><b>Customer/stakeholder business relations</b> - certain metrics are
sensitive and should not be seen by a customer or stakeholder, as this could
damage the business relationship. For example, awareness of detailed
cost/productivity data could lead a customer to demand smaller profit margins
on future contracts. For external customers, this risk can be managed via
selective release of status data to customers; but when the
customer/stakeholder happens to be within the same organization as the team
doing the work, data privacy controls come into play.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0px"><b>Protection from mismanagement</b> - certain
metrics are especially prone to improper use by management:</p>

<ul style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px">

<li>Some managers might not fully understand or respect data privacy, and
might desire access to metrics for malicious reasons (such as micromanagement
or punishment).</li>

<li>Other managers might have good intentions, but might still use metrics in
a way that would be a mistake (for example, to reward people for a certain
behavior)</li>

</ul>

<p style="margin-top: 0px">If personal metrics are ever used as a basis for
reward or punishment, individuals will change their behavior and begin
collecting metrics that make them look good. When this occurs, the metrics are
no longer useful for reward/punishment; but they also cease to be useful for
project management or process improvement. A single occurrence of this problem
within an organization is enough to damage trust and destroy a process
improvement initiative. Organizations can mitigate this risk with continual
management education and diligence; but not all organizations are successful,
and cultural differences make this a huge problem in certain parts of the
world.</p>

<h3>Competing Needs</h3>

<p style="margin-bottom:0px">Of course, data privacy needs must be balanced
with a set of competing needs for openness:</p>

<ul style="margin-top: 0px">
<li>Team management of cost, schedule, and quality</li>
<li>Investigation of potential data entry errors</li>
<li>One-on-one process coaching</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a number of ways we can meet these needs; but to the greatest
extent possible, we strive to meet them with the smallest data privacy
exposure.</p>


<h3>Spheres of Data Ownership</h3>

<p>The following broad categories of data deserve separate analysis:</p>

<table align="center"><tr>

<td style="text-align:center; border:1px solid black; padding:5px; font-weight:bold">
My Personal Data</td>

<td style="width:1cm">&nbsp;</td>

<td style="text-align:center; border:1px solid black; padding:5px; font-weight:bold">
Another Individual's Personal Data</td>

<td style="width:1cm">&nbsp;</td>

<td style="text-align:center; border:1px solid black; padding:5px; font-weight:bold">
Rollups for a User Group</td>

<td style="width:1cm">&nbsp;</td>

<td style="text-align:center; border:1px solid black; padding:5px; font-weight:bold">
Team Rollups</td>

</tr></table>

<p><b>My Personal Data</b> is always available to an individual within their
personal Process Dashboard.</p>

<p><b>Team Rollups</b> are always available in the Team Dashboard, to anyone
who has been granted Team Dashboard access.</p>

<p><b>Rollups for a User Group</b> are available in the Team Dashboard,
subject to a set of data privacy controls that prevent generating a report of
data for a single individual.</p>

<p><b>Another Individual's Personal Data</b> is the sphere of primary
importance for data privacy.  Personal data is currently available in the Team
Dashboard via the following mechanisms:</p>

<ul>

<li>When teams are using the Process Dashboard Enterprise Server, a coach can
be granted permission to open any individual's personal Process Dashboard and
have full access to their current and historical data.  This access can also
be granted on a person-by-person basis (e.g. Person X is granted permission to
open the personal dashboard for Person Y).</li>

<li>For one-time needs, an individual can save a 
<a href="../../help/Topics/AdvancedTopics/BackupData.html">data backup</a> of
their personal dashboard and share it with another person.  That person can
open the backup and view all data as it appeared the moment when the backup
was made.</li>

<li>Some reports in the Team Dashboard display anonymous granular data.  For
example, the Team Dashboard can display a team time log with all of the
fine-grained time log entries for the project; but the names of individuals
are not displayed in this log.  A person could theoretically correlate this
raw data to the responsible individuals, but it would require a nontrivial
effort.  Still, some teams may feel that this anonymous data should be
restricted to people with a "need to know."</li>

<li>Some reports in the Team Dashboard display a carefully selected subset of
personal metrics, which have been carefully judged to be "safe" or at least
"less sensitive."  Of course, these judgements are subjective, and the
"sensitive" line might fall in different places based on team size.</li>

</ul>


<h3>Data Privacy Permissions</h3>

<p>To meet the needs described above, the dashboard provides a number of
permissions allowing you to control whether an individual can see certain
types of (potentially sensitive) data.  The items in the "View Personal Data"
portion of the <a href="#addPerm">permissions tree</a> all fall into this
category.</p>

<p>When you grant these permissions to a role, you can grant the permission
for "Everyone," or for a particular user group:</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/team-edit-roles-perm-param.png"></p>

<p>If you wish to grant permission to view data in several different groups,
you can add the permission more than once, and select a different group each
time.</p>

<p>The default configuration of the Team Dashboard grants "All Permissions" to
"All Users."  This means that no special data privacy constraints are enforced
by default.  This is often appropriate for many teams, because the built-in
reports are already designed to limit the exposure of personal data.  But if
your team determines that additional protection is warranted, data privacy
permissions can be selectively granted to those users who have a "need to
know."</p>
