<P>The Process Dashboard is 100% Java, and will run on any system with a Java 2 
compliant virtual machine. This includes Windows, Linux, and Unix systems. (We 
haven't yet had an opportunity to test it on a Macintosh system, but don't 
anticipate any problems; we would love to <A 
href="mailto:processdash-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">hear from</A> a Macintosh 
user who would like to give the dashboard a try.)&nbsp; For access to forms and 
scripts, a web browser is also required.</P>
<P>To use the process dashboard, you must <B>first</B> install the following software:</P>

    <TD vAlign=top width="100%">
      <UL>
        <LI>The Java Runtime Environment, version 1.2 or 
      greater (available from <A target=_blank

        <LI><STRONG><U>One</U></STRONG> of the following web browsers 
        (<B><I>Internet Explorer is preferred</I></B>). 
        <UL>
          <LI>Internet Explorer 4.0 or greater 
          (available from <A target=_blank 
          href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.htm">Microsoft</A>).&nbsp; 
          If you choose to perform a custom installation of IE, make certain to 
          install the "Data Binding" option.
          <LI>Netscape 4.7 (available from <A 
          target=_blank 
          href="http://home.netscape.com/download/archive.html">Netscape</A>).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
          <B><STRONG>Note:</STRONG></B> Netscape 6.0 is <B><STRONG>not</STRONG></B> currently compatible with the 
          dashboard.</LI></UL>
        <LI>Make certain that Java and JavaScript are 
        enabled in your browser. (This is typically the default setting, so you 
        usually don't need to worry about enabling these unless you explicitly 
        disabled them in the past.) 
        <LI>If you connect to the internet via a proxy 
        server, you may need to tell your browser to bypass the proxy for the 
        address "localhost".&nbsp; The instructions below may not apply to your 
        browser word-for-word, but should hopefully get you pointed in the right 
        direction: 
        <UL>
          <LI>For Internet Explorer, choose 
          "Tools&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Internet&nbsp;Options". Click on the 
          "Connections" tab, then on the "LAN&nbsp;Settings" button.&nbsp; Make 
          certain the "Bypass proxy server for local addresses" box is <B><STRONG>checked</STRONG></B>.
          <LI>For Netscape, choose 
          "Edit&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Preferences".&nbsp; Under the Category 
          "Advanced&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Proxies",&nbsp; click the 
          "Manual&nbsp;proxy&nbsp;configuration" button, and ensure that the 
          "No&nbsp;Proxy&nbsp;for" box contains "localhost".</LI></UL>

<H2><A name=add_on></A>Add-on Process Sets</H2>
<P>The following processes do not come with the dashboard by default, but are 
easy to install:</P>
<TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 width="100%" border=0>

    <TD vAlign=top width="100%">

        <LI><A 
      name=SCRDCR 
      href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/processdash/SCR-DCR.jar">SCR/DCR</A> - a set of processes (inspired by PSP3) 
        created by the Hill AFB TaskView team for software development.&nbsp; 
        (These processes were distributed with version 1.1 of the dashboard, but 
        are no longer actively 
      supported.)</LI></UL></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>To install an add-on process set:</P>
<TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 width="100%" border=0>
  
  <TR>
    <TD vAlign=top width="100%">
      <UL>
        <LI>
        Locate the 
      file "   <I>pspdash.jar</I>" on your system.&nbsp; (If you are 
      on a Windows system, this file is most likely located in the directory 
      "<I>C:\Program Files\Process 
      Dashboard</I>".) 
        <LI>
        Click on a link above to download the add-on process set. When your 
        browser asks you whether you want to save the file or open it; choose 
        <B><I>Save</I></B>.&nbsp; Save the file into the directory you found in 
        the previous step. (In other words, the <I>pspdash.jar</I> file and the 
        add-on process file should be side-by-side in the same directory.&nbsp; 
        <STRONG><I>Do not</I></STRONG> overwrite the <I>pspdash.jar</I> file, just save the process file into 
        the same directory.)
        <LI>
        If the dashboard is running, you will need to restart it for the new 
        processes to be found. </LI>
