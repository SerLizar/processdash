<h1>Add Team Projects to Master Project (Program Leader)</h1>

<p>After you create the master project, you must tell the dashboard
which team projects it contains. To do so, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>

<li style='margin-top:9.0pt'>If the Team Dashboard is not already
running, start it using the appropriately named shortcut on the team
leader's computer. </li>


<li style='margin-top:9.0pt'>In the Team Dashboard window, select the
master project from the tree on the left.

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/master-scripts-subprojects.png"></p></li>


<li style='margin-top:9.0pt'>Select Edit List of Subprojects from the
list on the right. A web page will be displayed, allowing you to add
subprojects to the master project.

<p class="figure"><img
    src="../Images/master-edit-subproject-list.png"></p></li>

</ol>


<p>In the current version of the dashboard, note that the following
limitations apply:</p>

<ul>

<li style='margin-top:6.0pt'>A master project can only include team
projects from within the same team dashboard dataset.</li>

<li style='margin-top:6.0pt'>A master project can only include team
projects that are based upon the same metrics collection
framework.</li>

<li style='margin-top:6.0pt'>A team project can only belong to one
master project. If you attempt to add the team project to a second
master project, it will be silently removed from the first master
project.</li>

</ul>
