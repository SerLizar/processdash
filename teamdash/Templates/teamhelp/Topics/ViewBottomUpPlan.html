<h1>View Bottom-Up Team Plan</h1>
<b>(TSP Launch Meeting No. 6)</b>

<p>Once each team member has created their individual plan using the
steps above, you can view the consolidated team plan.</p>

<ol>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>In the Team Dashboard, use the hierarchy
menus to select the team project. Then use the script menu to select
&quot;Sync Work Breakdown Structure&quot; followed by &quot;Import All
Data Now.&quot;</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>Next, use the script menu to select Open
Earned Value Task &amp; Schedule. The task list for this project will
be displayed, and should include an entry for each member of the
team. Review this list to ensure that everything appears correct:

    <ul>

    <li>If any team member is not listed, then that person has not yet
    joined the team project.</li>

    <li>If any team member shows a PT of zero hours, then either that
    person has not yet created and exported their personal schedule by
    following the steps above, or they finished after you clicked the
    Import All Data Now button.</li>

    <li>If any team member's schedule is red and reports a &quot;task
    list missing&quot; error, it is likely that they did something
    unusual, like joining the project several times. To fix the
    problem, follow the instructions in the &quot;Add Member Schedules
    to Team Schedule&quot; section of this document.</li>

    </ul></li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>You can view the bottom-up earned value
plan for the project by clicking the Report button on the Task and
Schedule window.</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>To view the entire project plan, switch
to the Team Dashboard window, click the down-arrow to the right of the
script button to display the drop-down menu, and select the Project
Summary option. The project plan summary will appear in your Web
browser.

<p>This plan summary form will display the customized forms and
reports that were created earlier. For more information on the content
and customization of this form, see the section in this document
entitled, &quot;Creating / Customizing Process Forms and
Reports.&quot;</p>

<p>You can drill down into the subcomponents of your team plan by
clicking on the (<img src="../Images/icon-hier-nav.png">) icon.</p></li>

</ol>
