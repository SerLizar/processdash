<h1>Master Project Coordination and Planning</h1>

<p>Different organizations use different approaches to the planning of
a master project. One common approach is to conduct simultaneous
launch meetings for all of the team projects that make up a master
project. If your organization uses this approach, you will find the
information in this section useful.</p>

<h2>Opening the Work Breakdown Structure</h2>

<p>During a launch, most planning activities will be performed in the Work
Breakdown Structure Editor.  It is easy for several different subteams to be
working in the WBS Editor at the same time:</p>

<ol>

<li>When <a href="Installing.html">installing</a> the Process Dashboard, at
least one person from each team should choose the "Tools for Team Leaders"
option so they receive a Team Dashboard shortcut on their computer.  Or, if
you cannot bring this computer into the conference room where the launch is
being held, you can install the Team Dashboard on the conference room
computer.  (Of course, the conference room computer must still have a network
connection to the team's shared network directory.)</li>

<li>During the launch, use this shortcut to open the Team Dashboard.  You may
receive a message stating that another individual has the Team Dashboard open;
if so, click Yes to continue in read-only mode.</li>

<li>When the Team Dashboard window appears, select your team project from
the tree on the left.  Then choose Work Breakdown Structure Editor from the
list on the right.</li>

</ol>

<p>If individuals have already <a href="MembersJoin.html">joined</a> the
team project, individuals can also open the WBS Editor using the
corresponding option on the script menu in their personal dashboard.  If
you open the WBS Editor in this way and intend to edit the overall team
plan, you will probably want to open the WBS Editor's Team menu and make
certain the box to "Optimize Editing Operations for ..." is unchecked. (For
more information on this feature, see the help topic on personal editing
<a href="EditingWBSIndiv.html#indivEditMode">optimized mode</a>.)</p>


<h2>Sharing Team Dashboard Access</h2>

<p>There are a small number of launch planning tasks that are not performed
within the WBS Editor.  For example:</p>

<ul>

<li>Repairing a <a href="AddSchedules.html">missing schedule</a> error if
an team member did something unusual (like joining the project twice).</li>

<li>Creating the team's <a href="CreateQualityPlan.html">quality
plan</a>.</li>

</ul>

<p>These activities would be performed in the Team Dashboard itself, not in
the WBS Editor.  To perform these activities, you must open the Team
Dashboard in read-write mode.  However, only one person can have the Team
Dashboard open in read-write mode at a time. As a result, the various
subteams may need to coordinate with each other to determine who is using
the Team Dashboard at any given time.</p>

<p>Since these activities represent a relatively small portion of the
overall launch, it is very possible that the teams won't need to perform
these activities simultaneously.  If a particular subteam needs read-write
access to the Team Dashboard and they see that another team has it open, it
may be sufficient to contact the other team and ask them to close the Team
Dashboard if they are not using it.</p>

<p>If two subteams need to create their quality plans simultaneously, this
can be accomplished by using a special technique:</p>

<ol>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>The <u>leader of the master project</u>
should open the Team Dashboard on an appropriate computer.</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>If this computer has a personal firewall
installed, it should either be temporarily disabled, or configured to
allow incoming connections to port 3000 from within the local area
network (LAN).</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>The leader of
the master project should perform these steps for each team project:

    <ul>

    <li style='margin-top:6pt'>Choose one of the team projects from the
    tree on the left side of the Team Dashboard window.</li>

    <li style='margin-top:6pt'>Select Team Project Tools from the list
    on the right.</li>

    <li style='margin-top:6pt'>Scroll to the bottom of the page and
    find the link with the following label:

    <p style='margin-left:1cm;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>You can view this page from another
computer by visiting:<br>
    <span style='margin-left:1cm;text-decoration:underline;color:blue'>http://computer-name:3000/Project/Path/+/ABC-v1/team_tools.shtm</span></p>

    </li>

    <li style='margin-top:6pt'>Copy and paste this hyperlink, and send
    it to the team leader for the project in question.</li>

    <li style='margin-top:6pt'>The team leader can open this hyperlink in
    their web browser to access the Project Parameters and Settings page
    (where they will enter quality planning parameters) and the Rollup Plan
    Summary (where they can view the resulting quality plan).</li>

    <li style='margin-top:6pt'>Repeat these steps for the other team
    projects.</li>

    </ul>


<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>Leave the Team Dashboard running during
the planning sessions.</li>

</ol>

<td><b>Important:</b> Because organizations have different network
configurations, you should perform a dry run of these steps before
your launch. This way, if you encounter connectivity problems, you can
enlist your local tech support team in finding a resolution before the
launch begins, and avoid disruptions to the team planning process.
See the <a href="NetworkTroubleshooting.html">Network
Troubleshooting</a> help topic for more help.  If you discover that your
network will not support this special technique, you may need to schedule
your various quality planning sessions so they do not overlap.</td>

<h2>Viewing Consolidated Master Project Planning Data</h2>

<p>While the individual project teams are developing their detailed
plans, it is easy to see a master project view of the planning
progress. In the Team Dashboard, select the master project from the tree
on the left, then select Bottom-Up Work Breakdown Structure from the list
on the right.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/master-scripts-bottom-up-wbs.png"></p>

<p>The bottom up Work Breakdown Structure will be displayed.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/wbs-master-bottom-up.png"></p>


<p>This window displays a WBS containing all of the components and
tasks declared by all of the team projects that belong to this master
project. Since the data is rolled up and computed, it is read-only. If
you display the Bottom Up Time Panel, it will show the planned
completion dates of each team project.</p>

<p>The data in this window will update in near-real-time. Each time a
team project saves changes to their WBS, this window will see the
changes within a few seconds, and recalculate its display.</p>
