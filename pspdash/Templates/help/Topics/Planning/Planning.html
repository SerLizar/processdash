<P>Planning a software project is just as important as planning any other 
complicated endeavor.  In his book <I>A Discipline for Software 
Engineering</I> Watts Humphrey devotes three chapters to planning 
activities.  This help topic will not rehash the ideas put forth there, but 
will simply serve as a reminder that planning is essential!</P>

<P>The Process Dashboard can provide some help in your planning activities.  
The <a href="UsingHierarchyEditor.html">hierarchy editor</a> allows you to 
enter a work breakdown structure for your activities into the dashboard so 
that time, size, and defect data can be tracked, and the <a 
href="UsingProbeTool.html">PROBE tool</a> helps automate the <b>PRO</b>xy 
<b>B</b>ased <b>E</b>stimation method.&nbsp; Finally, the <a
href="UsingTaskSchedule.html">task and schedule tool</a> allows you to
create a schedule and track your progress against it using earned value.</P>
