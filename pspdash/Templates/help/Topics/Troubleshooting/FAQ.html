<P><HR><a name="MacInstall"></a><B>How can I install the Process Dashboard on 
   a Macintosh computer?</b>

<p>At this time, we do not have very much experience with installing or 
running the Dashboard on the Macintosh.  If you are running MacOS X, go ahead 
and try the standard Unix install procedure.</p>

<p>If you have any trouble getting the Dashboard installed and running 
properly on a Mac, <b>please</b> write us an email at 
<em>processdash-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</em>!  We would very much like to 
work with you one-on-one to work things out so that we can document the 
proper procedure.</p>


<P><HR><a name="NoServer"></a><B>My web browser displays an error message 
   when I try to view a script/form/chart/report/etc.  What is wrong?</B>

<P>The dashboard actually contains a very small HTTP server that provides all
the web content and thus the content cannot be displayed when the dashboard is
not running.  If you get an error message like "The page cannot be displayed -
cannot find server" from Internet Explorer, or "Netscape is unable to locate
the server localhost" from Netscape, check to make certain that the dashboard
is running.</p>

<P>If the dashboard <b>is</b> running, and you have <b>never</b> been able to
 view a script/form/chart/report, it may be that you need to adjust your proxy
 settings.  Many people work at companies where they do not have a direct
 connection to the internet, but instead must connect to the web via an HTTP
 proxy server. If this describes you, you may need to tell your browser to
 bypass the proxy for the address "localhost". The instructions below may not
 apply to your browser word-for-word, but should hopefully get you pointed in
 the right direction:
  <UL>
   <LI>For Internet Explorer, choose "Tools <img 
      src="../../Images/rarrow.png"> Internet Options". Click on the 
      "Connections" tab, then on the "LAN Settings" button. Make certain the 
      "Bypass proxy server for local addresses" box is 
      <b><strong>checked</strong></b>.</li>
   <LI>For Netscape, choose "Edit <img src="../../Images/rarrow.png"> 
      Preferences". Under the Category "Advanced <img 
      src="../../Images/rarrow.png"> Proxies", click the "Manual proxy 
      configuration" button, and ensure that the "No Proxy for" box contains 
      "localhost".</LI>
  </UL>

<p><hr><a name="SunPlugin"></a><b>My web browser is able to show the forms, 
but none of the entry blanks have any information.  What is wrong?</b>

<p>If you can see the HTML forms but they don't seem to be talking to the 
Dashboard, you may have a problem with the particular Java Plugin that has 
been installed in your browser.  We know that the Sun Java Plugin when 
running in Internet Explorer under windows has a problem.  To fix that 
problem:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Click on "Start <img src="../../Images/rarrow.png"> Settings <img 
   src="../../Images/rarrow.png"> Control Panel <img 
   src="../../Images/rarrow.png"> Java Plug In"</li>
 <li>Select the "Browser" tab</li>
 <li>Remove the checkmark next to "Microsoft Internet Explorer"</li>
 <li>Choose "Apply"</li>
 <li>You may have to restart IE</li>
</ol>

<p>If you are running on another system / browser and have this problem, 
please send us an email at 
<em>processdash-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</em></p> and we will attempt to 
help you with the problem.

<P><hr><A NAME="TwoForms"></A><b>If I have a dashboard script or form open,
and I click the script button to open another form, the new form appears in
my existing browser window, replacing the old form. Why can't I have two
forms open at once?</b>

<P>You can have as many scripts and forms open as you like! The behavior
you are seeing is a Microsoft "feature" designed to reduce clutter on your
screen. Fortunately, you can alter that behavior. The instructions below
may not apply to your browser word-for-word, but should hopefully get you
pointed in the right direction:

<OL>
  <LI>In Internet Explorer, choose "Tools <img 
      src="../../Images/rarrow.png"> Internet Options".</LI>
  <LI>Click the "Advanced" tab.</LI>
  <LI>Remove the checkmark next to the option, "Reuse windows for
      launching shortcuts."</LI>
</OL>

<P><HR><a name="NoConnection"></a><B>All my data elements say "NO 
CONNECTION".  What is wrong?</B>

<P>The forms always display "live" data - this allows them to auto-recalculate
numbers (like a spreadsheet does) when you edit data.  It also allows changes
made in one browser window to appear immediately in other browser windows. To
make all this happen, the browser maintains an open connection to the
dashboard, and passes data back and forth across this connection.</P>

<P>If you are viewing a form, and you close the main dashboard window, this
open connection is closed as well.  When this occurs, the form immediately
displays "NO CONNECTION" to let you know that your changes are no longer making
it back to the dashboard's data repository. To fix the problem, you must
<OL>
 <LI>restart the dashboard</li>
 <LI>click the refresh/reload button on your browser.</li>
</OL>

<P>If the dashboard <em>is running</em> and you are still getting "NO 
CONNECTION" in the data elements, it could be that the data port that the 
dashboard is trying to use is already taken on your machine.  Normally the 
dashboard will search for an open port to establish the connection, making 
this kind of problem unlikely.  However, if you have overridden this behavior 
in the configuration file the dashboard will not search for a port and may be 
experiencing a conflict with some other process on your machine.  To fix this 
problem, you must</p>
<OL>
 <LI>stop the dashboard</li>
 <LI>remove the following line from your configuration file:
  <pre>
   http.port=&lt;some port number&gt;
  </pre>
 </li>
 <li>restart the dashboard</li>
</ol>

<P>This will allow the dashboard to search for an available communications 
port.</p>

<P><HR><a name="ERROR"></a><B>Some of my data elements say
"<code>#VALUE!</code>" or "<code>#DIV/0!</code>". What is wrong?</B>

<P>"<code>#VALUE!</code>" indicates that the dashboard cannot calculate a 
value because the formula references a value that is missing (displayed as 
"<CODE>?????</CODE>") or otherwise invalid (for example, a value like 
"<CODE>foo</CODE>" when a number was expected).  When you see 
"<code>#VALUE!</code>" in a dashboard form, it almost <I>always</I> means 
that there is a "<code>?????</code>" field somewhere that you still need to 
fill in. If you fill in all the "<code>?????</code>" fields and the 
"<code>#VALUE!</code>" field does not recalculate, check to ensure that the 
calculation is not <A HREF="../Planning/DataFreezing.html">frozen</A>.</P>

<P>"<code>#DIV/0!</code>" indicates that the dashboard encounted a 
divide-by-zero error when calculating a particular data value. Many times 
this is due to having a very small number of usable data points recorded by 
the dashboard.  For instance, if you start the dashboard for the first time 
and try to look at Process Summary forms for a PSP2.1 process, the "% To 
Date" fields will be filled with "<code>#DIV/0!</code>".  This is because the 
total amount of time recorded in the tool is 0.  The percentage calculation 
attempts to divide by zero and returns the error.</P> 

<P>Another problem can contribute to this condition as well.  If you are not 
in the habit of clicking the little "completion" checkbox at the right end of 
the dashboard, some (or all) of your data will be ignored by the dashboard 
when creating reports and graphs.  The reporting features of the dashboard 
only report tasks/projects that are marked as complete.  See the <a 
href="../Execution/CompletionButton.html">Using the Completion Checkbox</a> 
help topic for more information.</P>

<P><HR><a name="BadExcel"></a><B>I tried to export my data to Excel with the 
link on one of the forms, but I just got a small ASCII file.  What is 
wrong?</B>

<P>For the "Export to Excel" functionality to work seamlessly, you must have 
the ".IQY" file type properly set up on your system.  This setup is normally 
performed by Microsoft Office during the installation process for Excel
(although, notably, certain releases of Office 97 do not perform this
setup).</p>

<P>If the IQY file type is not properly set up, clicking the "Export to 
Excel" links may instead cause Notepad to appear with a short, three-line 
text file. Alternatively, that three line text file might appear in an Excel 
spreadsheet.</p>

<P>If you encounter such problems, the simplest fix is to add the
following line to your <a
href="../AdvancedTopics/ConfigurationFile.html">configuration file</a>:</p>

<pre> excel.exportMethod=mime</pre>

<p>And data will be exported to Excel <A
HREF="../PostmortemAnalysis/ExportingData.html#static">statically</A>.</P>

<P><HR><a name="NoSubmit"></A><B>Why is there no "submit" button on the HTML 
forms?</B>

<P>The HTML forms used by the dashboard are continually "live".  There is no 
need to press a submit button to send your data to the dashboard.  Simply 
enter your data where necessary, and the dashboard will record it.  However,
after editing a data field, it is usually necessary to leave that field for
your changes to take effect.  You can press the TAB button or click somewhere
else on the page. If the data you are changing is related to other data items 
on the page, you should see the other data elements update. For more
information, see the <A HREF="../Planning/EnteringData.html">Entering process 
data</A> help topic.</P>


<P><HR><a name="TimerUpdate"></a><B>I've started the timer, but none of the 
numbers on my reports are changing.  How can I know that it is working?</b>

<p>When the timer is running and you first navigate to an activity, the
dashboard will not create an entry in the time log until you have spent a full
minute there; this is by design.  For a more detailed explanation, see the
help topic for the <a href="../Execution/PlayPause.html#timelogdelay">play /
pause button</a>.</P>

<P>Also, the dashboard will make a quiet "tick" sound whenever the timer 
starts and when a new project or project phase is chosen by the hierarchy 
menus when the timer is running. If you do not hear this sound, check the 
state of the play/pause button.  The current state of the timer can always be 
determined by positioning the mouse pointer over the play/pause button.  A 
tooltip help will pop up containing the current state.</p> 


<P><HR><a name="FrozenData"></a><B>I made a mistake in one of my numbers on 
the Project Plan Summary form, but the form won't let me change the numbers! 
What can I do?</b>

<P>The dashboard will "freeze" your planning data once you have completed the 
planning phase by clicking the completion checkbox.  Also it will freeze all 
the data when the project is marked as complete.  You can make these numbers 
editable by marking either the project or the planning phase incomplete 
again.  For more info on freezing data see the <a 
href="../Planning/DataFreezing.html">data freezing</a> and the <a 
href="../Execution/CompletionButton.html">completion checkbox</a> help 
topics.</p>


<P><HR><a name="FormsColors"></a><b>What is the significance of the different 
text colors on the PSP process scripts and forms?</b>

<P>In his book <I>A Discipline for Software Engineering</I> where he outlines 
the Personal Software Process, Watts Humphrey introduces the various process 
elements for doing PSP work in a graduated manner.  Each PSP process is built 
upon the previous one.  As a way of showing which process elements were added 
to the previous process definition, the forms in the book highlight the new 
process elements in <b><i>bold italics</i></b>.  These highlighted elements
return to normal text at the next process level. In our attempt to make our
online forms as identical to the PSP forms as possible, we have included that
detail.</P>

<P>However, the Process Dashboard makes certain steps on the scripts and forms
unnecessary (e.g. instructions to sum up various data items -- the dashboard
sums them for you).  These unnecessary process steps are displayed as
greyed-out text.</P>

<P>Also, there are places where the dashboard <i>slightly</i> changes the way
certain steps are performed (e.g.  instead of performing a PROBE calculation,
the PROBE tool should be used).  Green text is used to indicate this slight
departure from the <i>true</i> PSP scripts and forms.</P>

<P><HR><a name="ExtDocFail"></a><b>I click on a document hyperlink in a 
process script, but the document never opens.</b>

<P>For maximum portability, the document templates provided with the 
dashboard are rich text files (.rtf). Some browsers (most notably Netscape on 
the Linux platform) don't know what to do with a rich text file, and so they 
prompt you to save it (not very helpful). To solve this problem, you must:</P> 

<OL>
  <LI>Obtain a program capable of editing rich text files, and install it
   on your machine. ("Star Office" is one possibility; it is free and runs 
   on Linux.)</LI>
  <LI>Configure your web browser, and tell it that files ending with ".rtf" 
   and/or files of mime type "application/rtf" should be opened with the 
   program you just installed.</LI>
</OL>

<p><hr><a name="ProcessTweak"></a><b>I'd like to make a minor change in one 
of the process scripts.  Can I do that?</b>

<p>Yes you can!  Please see the section on <a 
href="../AdvancedTopics/ProcessDefinition/HowDashboardFindsFiles.html#OverwritingScript">overwriting 
process scripts</a> in the help topic that describes how the dashboard finds 
the script files.</p>

<P><HR><a name="WhereIsConfig"></A><B>Where is the configuration file located?</B>

<P>The configuration file is named <code>.pspdash</code> on Unix systems and
<code>pspdash.ini</code> on Windows systems.  It can be located in either of
two places: the user's data directory or the user's home directory (on Unix 
systems).  The dashboard looks in the data directory first, then in the user's
home directory.  To find out exactly where your configuration file is located,
choose "About" from the configuration menu, then click on the link for "user
settings". See the <a
href="../AdvancedTopics/ConfigurationFile.html">configuration file</A> help
topic for more information about the configuration file and the settings that
can be defined there.</P>

<P><HR><a name="WhereData"></a><B>Where is my PSP data stored?</B>
<P>The dashboard stores all of your data in a single directory, in plain text
files.  This directory is often referred to in this documentation as the "data
directory".  With the current default configuration, data is always stored in
the "current working directory" when the dashboard is run.</P>

<P>On Windows systems, the "current working directory" is set by the icon you
use to run the dashboard.  If you right-click on that icon and choose
"Properties", there will be a text field labelled "Start in:" which identifies
your data directory.  Altering this value will change the location where the
dashboard looks for your data.  It is possible to have multiple, independent
data directories all on the same machine; just make copies of the icon you use
to start the dashboard, and give each icon a different value for the "Start in"
directory.</P>

<P>You can find out the exact location of your data directory by choosing 
"Help <img src="../../Images/rarrow.png"> About Process Dashboard" from the 
configuration menu, then clicking on the link for "user settings".</p>


<P><HR><a name="MoveData"></A><B>How can I backup my psp data and/or move it 
to another computer?</B>

<P>If you want to backup your psp data, simply back up the contents of your
<a href="#WhereData">data directory</a>.  To move your psp data to a different
computer,</p>

<UL>
<LI>stop the dashboard if it is running</LI>
<LI>copy the contents of your data directory to a directory on the new
    computer</LI>
<LI>run the dashboard on the new computer, using the chosen directory as the
    data directory.</LI></UL>


<p><hr><a name="CorruptFiles"></a><b>I got a warning box that claims that my data files have been corrupted!  Can I get my data back?</b>

<p>If you did not continue running the dashboard when the dialog warned you 
that doing so could be quite dangerous, then yes, you probably can.</p>

<p>If you see this message, realize that the dashboard is being overly cautious
with your data.  As long as you didn't plow on ahead and run the dashboard 
with the questionable files in place, no data has been lost yet.  The best 
steps to take next are:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Examine the corrupt files mentioned in the warning message.  If they are 
   of zero length, then there is most likely nothing to worry about. Just 
   delete the zero length files and restart the dashboard.</li>
 <li>If the files contain something, examine their contents.  Removing the 
   "tttt" at the beginning of the filename should indicate what <em>real</em> 
   file was being created at the time the problem was detected. See if the 
   temporary files contain any data that is missing from the original file, 
   and copy it over if necessary.  Finally, delete the temporary files and 
   restart the dashboard.</li>
</ol>

<p>Even though the Dashboard has been designed to be safe with your precious 
process data, it is still a good idea to back up the Dashboard's data 
directory every so often.  See the question about <a href="#MoveData">backing 
up your Dashboard data</a> for more information.</p>


<p><hr><a name="HideFinished"></a><b>Can I hide my finished projects from the 
hierarchy browser (and other screens)?  They are starting to pile up and are 
taking up a lot of space.</b>

<p>Unfortunately, No.  We have this as a feature request.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the Cut and Paste features in the hierarchy browser will 
allow you to move your completed projects away from the part of the hierarchy 
where you are doing your active development.  You could create a node at the 
top of the project hierarchy called "Archived Projects" and Cut and Paste 
your finished projects as children under it.  They would still count towards 
your PROBE Estimates and your Planning data.  See the <a 
href="UsingHierarchyEditor.html">hierarchy editor</a> help topic for more 
information.</p>


<p><hr><a name="OutlierProject"></a><b>I have a project in my hierarchy that 
doesn't have much to do with my current development habits.  Can I mark it as 
an "outlier" so that it doesn't corrupt the Planning and PROBE estimates?</b>

<p>There are basically two concerns when in this kind of situation.</p>
<ol>
 <li>Removing the project from PROBE Estimates</li>
 <li>Removing the project from Planning and To Date calculations</li>
</ol>

<p>The most important time to identify a project as an outlier is during 
PROBE-style linear regression.  This is easy to do; when using the PROBE 
tool, you can click on the "Chart" button to visually identify outliers, 
and the "Filter" button to remove any outliers from the regression 
calculation.  The PROBE Wizard will also let you remove various data pairings 
from the regression calculation, but it won't show you a graph and thus isn't 
as intuitive.  See the <a href="../Planning/UsingProbeTool.html">PROBE 
Tool</a> and <a href="../Planning/UsingProbeWizard.html">PROBE Wizard</a> 
help topics for more information.</p>

<p>To remove a project's effects from Planning and To Date calculations, you 
can make use of multiple data sets.  By defining a customized data set for 
your current project, you can isolate only the data you know is applicable.  
See the <a href="../AdvancedTopics/MultipleToDateData.html">multiple To Date 
data</a> help topic for more information.</p>

<p>A less desireable but simpler way to remove a project's effects would be 
to mark the project as incomplete.  The To Date, Planning, and PROBE 
calculations only use completed projects for their data sets.  The drawback 
with this approach is that you will lose the accurate completion date for the 
project that you mark incomplete.</p>

<P><HR><a name="DCRSCR"></a><b>What happened to the DCR and SCR processes?</b>

<P>The DCR and SCR processes were shipped with version 1.1 of the
Process Dashboard.  They were later removed from the main dashboard
and distributed as add-on process sets.  As of version 1.4.1, they are
no longer available.</P>

<P>Explicit written permission from Addison-Wesley is required to modify
PSP scripts or distribute modified PSP scripts.  Since the DCR/SCR process
scripts were derived from the copyrighted PSP process scripts in <i>A
Discipline for Software Engineering</i>, they fall into this category.
We have not attempted to obtain that permission from Addison-Wesley, so
these processes are no longer available.</p>

<P><HR><a name="Auto"></a><B>I would like to integrate the dashboard more 
closely with my IDE. Is it possible to programatically start/stop the timer, 
and change the active hierarchy path?</B>

<P>Yes! If you issue an HTTP request of the form:

<PRE><FONT SIZE="-2">http://localhost:2468/control/startTiming.class</FONT></PRE>

the dashboard timer will start.  Similarly, an HTTP request of the form:

<PRE><FONT SIZE="-2">http://localhost:2468/control/stopTiming.class</FONT></PRE>

will pause the timer. And

<PRE><FONT SIZE="-2">http://localhost:2468/Non+Project/foo//control/setPath.class</FONT></PRE>

will change the current hierarchy path to "/Non Project/foo". If you want
to change the current hierarchy path <b>and</b> start the timer, use

<PRE><FONT SIZE="-2">...//control/setPath.class<B>?start</B></FONT></PRE>

<B>Note</B>: these commands will have no effect unless the HTTP
request originates from the same machine where the dashboard is
running.

<P><HR><A NAME="TeamSupport"></A><b>Does the Process Dashboard support
teams?</b>

<P>The current version of the dashboard <I>does</I> contain features that
make it possible to roll up individual data to the team level. This "team
roll-up" capability should be considered "beta" functionality.  If your TSP
team is using the dashboard, and would like to evaluate these features,
please send email to <I>processdash-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</I> for
assistance.</p>

<P><HR><a name="Website"></a><b>Where can I get the latest information about 
the Process Dashboard?</b>

<P>The latest developments in the development of the Process Dashboard, 
including the latest version, can be found at 
<em>http://processdash.sourceforge.net.</em></p>

<P><HR><a name="BugReport"></a><B>I think I've found a bug.  Whom do I contact?</b>

<P>If you like, you can fill out a bug form on our web site at 
<EM>http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=9858&amp;atid=109858</EM>.  The 
simplest way to do this is just to pick "Help" <img 
src="../../Images/rarrow.png"> "Submit bug report" from the dashboard's "C" 
menu.  This will open your web browser pointed right to the bug form.</p>
