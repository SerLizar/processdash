<h1>PSP<sup>(SM)</sup> Process Distribution</h1>

<p>The Process Dashboard is a general-purpose tool designed to support
the enactment of any defined process.  It is especially useful for
supporting metrics-intensive, high-maturity processes.  Although the
dashboard is best known for its support of the Personal Software
Process<sup>(SM)</sup> (PSP), it can be used just as effectively with
any defined process.  In addition, many features of the dashboard,
such as the earned value tracking tool, can be used independently of a
defined process.</p>

<p>The first versions of the dashboard were distributed with PSP
scripts and forms bundled-in.  The dashboard development team was
originally under the impression that this was permitted, since the
copyright page of the original PSP book contains the statement:

<blockquote class="ital">The tables in appendix C of this book or
electronic copies thereof may be copied, used, or modified by owners
of this book or users of the materials it contains.</blockquote>

The dashboard development team originally interpreted this statement
as written permission from the publisher to make electronic copies of
the scripts and forms in Appendix C of the book <u>A&nbsp;Discipline
for Software Engineering</u>, and incorporate those materials into the
dashboard download.  (Apparently, other development teams must have
made the same assumption, because several other PSP tools already in
existence in 1997 also included PSP scripts and forms.)</p>

<p>However, in February of 2002, Watts Humphrey (the author of the PSP
book) brought it to our attention that the statement in the book does
not grant permission to <u>distribute</u> electronic copies of the PSP
scripts and forms. For that, special permission is needed.</p>

<p>Mr. Humphrey worked with Addison-Wesley to arrange permission for
the PSP scripts and forms to once again be distributed for use with
the dashboard, beginning with version 1.6 of the Process Dashboard.
For several years, the installer for the Process Dashboard would
provide the option of downloading and installing the PSP materials
after individuals consented to Addison-Wesley's license agreement.</p>

<p>In 2005, Watts Humphrey published a new PSP book entitled
<u>A&nbsp;Self-Improvement Process for Software Engineers</u>.  With
the release of this book, the PSP materials were revised.  Also, many
of the materials were separated from the book and made available as an
electronic download from the Software Engineering Institute.</p>

<p>The Process Dashboard development team once again worked with the
Software Engineering Institute, and obtained permission to distribute
the updated PSP materials.  The SEI granted this permission, but
<u>with conditions</u>: most significantly, we must collect contact
information from each person who downloads the PSP materials, and send
this information to the SEI.  (This requirement is <u>not</u> specific
to the Process Dashboard; people are required to provide the same
contact information when they download these materials from the SEI
website.)</p>

<p>The Process Dashboard is a freely available open source
application.  We <u>will not</u> require people to enter contact
information before downloading the Process Dashboard.  So to meet our
legal obligations under the permission statement written by the SEI,
it was necessary to completely remove the copyrighted PSP materials
from the main Process Dashboard download.</p>

<p>So in Process Dashboard version 1.11 and later, the PSP materials
are distributed in the following way:</p>

<ul>

<li>When you download the main Process Dashboard application, no
    copyrighted PSP materials are included in the download.</li>

<li style="margin-top: 10px">It is still possible to create PSP
    projects, capture data, and analyze your progress.</li>

<li style="margin-top: 10px">If you are a long-time user of the
    Process Dashboard, you can continue to use the legacy PSP
    materials that you received when you installed Process Dashboard
    versions 1.6 through 1.10. (These materials are based upon the old
    book, <u>A&nbsp;Discipline for Software Engineering</u>.)</li>

<li style="margin-top: 10px">Users who are installing the Process
    Dashboard for the first time will initially not have access to the
    PSP scripts or forms:</li>

    <ul>

    <li>The PSP scripts will not be available until you download the
        PSP materials. Since the scripts are the primary
        differentiator between the different PSP levels, the Hierarchy
        Editor will only give the option of creating PSP2.1
        projects. (PSP0 - PSP2 will not be available.)</li>

    <li>Instead of the standard PSP Project Planning Summary forms, a
        simple customizable form will be provided.  If you do not wish
        to download the PSP materials, you can instead customize this
        form as desired.</li>

    <li>The Size Estimating Template will not be available.  As a
        result, you will not be able to use tools like PROBE to
        produce estimates unless you download the PSP materials.</li>

    </ul>

<li style="margin-top: 10px">Active users of the PSP are encouraged to
    download the new PSP materials from
    <u>http://www.processdash.com/</u>&nbsp;.&nbsp; The new materials
    provide the following benefits:</li>

    <ul>

    <li>Project plan summary forms are customizable, allowing you to
        add charts and reports that support your personal process
        improvement goals.</li>

    <li>The Size Estimating Template provides new interactive
        functionality. For example, you can define your own
        size-per-item tables, and the size of added parts will be
        computed automatically when you enter their type and relative
        size.</li>

    <li>Scripts and forms display the updated terminology that appears
        in the recent PSP book, <u>A&nbsp;Self-Improvement Process for
        Software Engineers</u>.</li>

    </ul>

</ul>
