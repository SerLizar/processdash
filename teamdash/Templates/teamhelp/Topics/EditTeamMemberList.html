<h1>Enter List of Team Members</h1>

<b>(TSP Launch Meeting No. 2)</b>

<p>The dashboard needs a list of project team members to facilitate
planning later in the launch. If you wish, you may enter this data
before the launch begins; otherwise, you can enter this information
during the launch. The list of team members can be edited at any
time.</p>

<ol>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>In the script menu for the team project,
choose the Edit Team Member List option. The Team List Editor will
appear.

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/team-list.png"></p></li>


<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>Using one line per team member, enter the following required information:

    <ul style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>

    <li style='margin-top:6.0pt'>Enter the team member's full name in
    the first column.</li>

    <li style='margin-top:6.0pt'>Enter the team member's initials in
    the second column. These initials should correspond to the values
    the person provided when they joined the team project. No two
    individuals should have the same initials; if you happen to have
    two people on your project with the same initials, have one select
    a different string of letters.</li>

    <li style='margin-top:6.0pt'>The color in the third column will be
    used later to quickly distinguish between individuals. If you
    decide to change the default color provided for an individual, try
    to ensure that the final list is comprised of mutually dissimilar
    colors.</li>

    <li style='margin-top:6.0pt'>In the fourth column, enter the
    approximate number of hours each team member plans to spend per
    week on productive project work.</li>

    </ul>

If you need to delete an entry from the list, simply delete the name
and initials for that row. When you save and reopen the team list,
that row will be automatically removed.</li>


<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>Click the Save button when you are
finished editing the list of team members.</li>

</ol>
