<h1>Software Upgrade Needed</h1>

<p>New planning capabilities have been added to the Process Dashboard, and
your project team has chosen to use these new features.  Unfortunately, the
software on this computer is out-of-date.  To fully participate in your team's
project plan, you need to upgrade.</p>

<!--#if Dash_Package_pspdash lt 'version 2.0.9' -->
    <div class="alertError">You are running Process Dashboard version
    <!--#echo Dash_Package_pspdash -->, but you need version 2.0.9 or
    higher.</div>
<!--#endif-->

<!--#if !Dash_Package_tpidw-embedded -->
    <div class="alertError">You have not installed the "Relational Database
    Extensions" add-on.</div>
<!--#elif Dash_Package_tpidw-embedded lt 'version 1.3.1' -->
    <div class="alertError">You are running version 
    <!--#echo Dash_Package_tpidw-embedded --> of the "Relational Database
    Extensions" add-on, but you need version 1.3.1 or higher.</div>
<!--#endif-->
</p>

<p>To resolve these problems, please contact your team leader and install an
upgraded version of the Process Dashboard.</p>
