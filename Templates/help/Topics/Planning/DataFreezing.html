<P>By default, the dashboard will "freeze" appropriate pieces of data when
the corresponding project phase is marked as completed.  The two points
where this happens are at the end of the Planning phase and at the end of
the project.</p>

<P>In PSP process levels 0.1 and above, when you are planning your project 
the dashboard will use your historical data to help you create an estimate of 
how your total time will be distributed across the process phases.  Once you 
click the completion checkbox to complete the planning phase, all your 
Planned data will be baselined. The estimates you entered for size and time, 
along with all the calculated computed data elements for estimated data, will 
be frozen so that your planned data will always stay constant.</p>

<P>Similarly, when you mark the project complete, the To Date numbers will be 
brought up to date and frozen.  This will enable you to view this report 
again in the future without having the To Date numbers changing in the 
report.</p>

<P>One side effect of the freezing of data is that if you want to change
your time or size estimate, you will have to navigate back to the Planning
phase and mark it as incomplete by clicking the completion checkbox again.
Once it has been marked as incomplete the dashboard will allow you to enter
a different estimate.</p>

<p>The same is true of the To Date items on the report.  If you navigate back
to an old project and start logging time to it, the Actual columns will
update as required, but the To Date columns will not.  You will need to mark
the project as incomplete so that the To Date items will thaw out and
recalculate.</p>

<p>The Project Completion checkbox is located on the Project Plan Summary 
form.</p>
