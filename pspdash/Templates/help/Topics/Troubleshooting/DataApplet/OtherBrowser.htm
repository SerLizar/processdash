<H1>Problem with browser</H1>

<P>We're sorry, but your browser is not currently capable of
supporting the dashboard's data integration features.

<P>The dashboard <b>can</b> integrate with the following browsers:

<ul>

<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.htm">Internet
    Explorer</a> 4.0 or greater <i>(on Windows systems only)</i>

<li><a href="http://home.netscape.com/download/archive.html">Netscape 4.7</a>
    <i>(on most platforms)</i>, and 
    <a href="http://home.netscape.com/download">higher versions of
    Netscape</a> <i>(on Windows systems)</i>

</ul>

<p>Don't worry - you can still keep using your current web browser as
the system-default, and use a different web browser with the
dashboard. To correct this problem, print this page and follow the
instructions below:</p>

<ol>

<li>Choose between the options listed above, and make certain you have an
appropriate browser installed on your system.

<li><i>(Windows)</i> If you installed an appropriate browser <b>and</b>
made that browser your system default, you're done. Otherwise, continue.

<li>Shut down the dashboard if it is running.

<li>Open your configuration file (which is located at 
<code><!--#include file="/control/showenv.class?config" --></code>)
and add one of the following lines to that file:

<pre>     browser.command=<font color="#FF0000">C:/Program Files/Internet Explorer/IExplore.exe</font></pre>

if you want the dashboard to display scripts and forms in Internet Explorer, or

<pre>     browser.command=<font color="#FF0000">C:/Program Files/Netscape/Communicator/Program/Netscape.exe</font></pre>

to use Netscape. <b>NOTE: make certain to edit the browser path</b> (the
part in red above) so it correctly points to the executable for the browser
you wish to use. To separate directory names, use either a forward slash
(&quot;<code><font color="#FF0000">/</font></code>&quot;) or a double
backslash (&quot;<code><font color="#FF0000">\\</font></code>&quot;).

<li>Restart the dashboard, and open any script or form.  The script/form
should appear in your newly designated browser.<br><br><b>Troubleshooting:</b>
<ul>

<li>If the form opens in the same browser as before, then you either failed
to correctly locate your configuration file, or you mistyped the
&quot;<code>browser.command=</code>&quot; portion of the configuration
line.  Go back to step 3, but be more careful in step 4 to correctly open
and edit the file.

<li>If you receive an error dialog, then you most likely made an error in
the line you added to the configuration file.  Open your configuration file
(<code><!--#include file="/control/showenv.class?config" --></code>)
and doublecheck that you specified the correct path and filename to your
web browser. Remember that you must separate directory names either with
forward slashes (&quot;<code><font color="#FF0000">/</font></code>&quot;)
or double backslashes (&quot;<code><font
 color="#FF0000">\\</font></code>&quot;).

</ul>

</ol>
