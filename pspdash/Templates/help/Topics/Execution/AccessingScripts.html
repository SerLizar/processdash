<H1>Accessing the Process Scripts</H1>
<P>Most of the scripts necessary to perform your work are already included in 
the Process Dashboard.  In particular, the process scripts for all of the PSP 
levels described in <I>A Discipline for Software Engineering</I> are included.</P>

<P>To access process scripts, hit the script button on the dashboard.</P>

<P><center><IMG SRC="../../Images/PointToScriptButton.png"></center></P>

<P>This will start a web browser (if necessary) and point it at an 
appropriate process script based on which process stage is currently active.</P>

<P><center><IMG SRC="../../Images/PSP0DevelopmentScript.png"></center></P>

<P>This example shows a project calling up the Development script for PSP 
level 0.</P>

<P>When you click the script button, it will generally display the script for
the phase which is currently selected by the hierarchy menus.  Most of the
online forms allow you to navigate back to the "top" of the set of process
scripts by a link labelled "Top".  Also, a link which will take you on to the
next phase in the given process is usually shown as well.</P>

<a name="scriptIcons"></a><h2><A NAME="pullDown"></A>The script button pull-down</h2>
<P>The script button pull-down tab allows you to choose a particular form in 
a more direct manner.  Clicking the pull-down on the forms button will bring 
up a menu of the most commonly used scripts and forms available for the current process.  Choosing 
one of these will open the named script or form.</p>

<P>You can also select the &quot;More...&quot; option at the bottom of the
menu to bring up a script browser. The script browser shows your hierarchy
on the left; when you highlight a node in the hierarchy, it displays the
available scripts and forms on the right. You can open one of those scripts
or forms by double-clicking on it.</p>

<P>The script browser makes it easy to pull up forms for historical
projects without first needing to navigate the hierarchy menus to that
project.</p>

<h2>The timing icons</h2><P>Many of the process 
scripts contain little stopwatch icons on them.  These icons provide another 
way to navigate and time a process phase.  When you click on one of these 
icons, the current phase being measured will change to the phase indicated by 
the icon and the timer will start measuring time for that phase.</p>

<H2>External documents</H2>

<P>Creating or obtaining documents is often an integral part of performing
a process. The dashboard process scripts sometimes provide hyperlinks for
these documents. If you click on a document hyperlink, the dashboard will:</p>

<OL>
  <LI>Possibly ask you for pertinent information. For example, the
    dashboard may need to know the name of a directory where it should
    store documents     for this project, and it may display a form
    requesting that information. Once you provide this information and
    click &quot;OK,&quot; the dashboard generally won't have to ask for it
    again.</LI>
  <LI>Check to see if the file already exists. If not, it may be able to
    create the file from a template.</LI>
  <LI>Open the file for editing.</LI>
</OL>

<h2>Entering data into the forms</h2>

<P>The various forms necessary to do your work have data entry fields which 
are to be used to capture the various process metrics.  The forms are 
continually "live", which means they are always ready and waiting for input.  
There is no "submit" or "send" button on the forms.  Just enter the data in 
the blanks and the dashboard will record it. Some blanks on the forms are greyed out.  These data elements are computed 
by the dashboard and do not require data input. For more information, see
the <A HREF="../Planning/EnteringData.html">Entering data</A> help topic.</P>
