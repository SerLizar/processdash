<h1>Managing Team Data (Team Leader)</h1>

<p>As a member of the team, the team leader will need to use his or
her <i>personal instance</i> of the Process Dashboard to perform
project tasks, following the general instructions provided above for
all team members. The <i>team instance</i> of the Process Dashboard
requires minimal attention and requires no data entry. When running,
it provides many useful features for project planning and
tracking.</p>

<h2>Project Plan Summary</h2>

<p>The Team Project Plan Summary is a very useful tool for tracking
team progress. You can open the team plan summary by selecting it from
the drop-down menu on the Script button of the Team Dashboard
window. The Team Project Plan Summary contains earned value reports
for the project, quality reports and charts, and reports of overall
project metrics.</p>

<p>The Team Project Plan Summary can be very helpful in weekly team
meetings. As long as the Team Dashboard is running on a computer that
is connected to the network, you can view the team plan summary in a
Web browser on any other computer on the network (for example, a
computer in your conference room). The Team Project Tools and Settings
page will provide you with the URL you can use to remotely access the
plan summary.</p>

<p>Also, remember that the Project Plan Summary is editable.  If you
don't find a particular metric or chart on your report, put the report
into editing mode and add it.  If you don't find the metric you're
looking for in the list of provided items, please contact the Process
Dashboard development team.  We're always open to suggestions on how
to make the dashboard better!</p>


<h2>Earned Value Reports</h2>

<p>The Team Project Plan Summary includes earned value reports for the
project. These reports roll up the individual earned value plans owned
by each team member into a single earned value plan for the entire
team.</p>

<p>Near the top of the team earned value report, you will find a
<i>Show Weekly View</i> hyperlink. Clicking this hyperlink will
display a chronological cross section of the project schedule that
summarizes the accomplishments of the previous week and lists the
tasks scheduled to be completed in the coming week. This is very
useful in the weekly team meeting.</p>

<p>Once the team has collected a minimum amount of earned value data,
these earned value reports will include forecasts for overall project
cost and completion date. You will notice that the team earned value
plan typically includes two different forecasts for the project
completion date.</p>

<ul>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'><b>Forecast Completion Date</b> is the
date the project is forecast to finish if no tasks are reassigned. If
the workload becomes unbalanced and tasks are not reassigned, then
some team members will finish earlier than others. Accordingly,
Forecast Completion Date is calculated by looking at each team
member's schedule and identifying the date the last person is
projected to finish. </li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'><b>Optimized Forecast Completion
Date</b> is the date the project is forecast to finish if tasks are
rebalanced optimally. If you were able to reassign work perfectly so
every team member finished at the same time, the project might
complete on the calculated date.</li>

</ul>

<p>Practically speaking, it is rarely possible to keep the workload
perfectly balanced, so a realistic forecast completion date would fall
between the two dates provided above. When the two forecast dates
differ significantly, the project workload is unbalanced and tasks
likely need to be reassigned.</p>

<p>At times, you may need to drill down into the earned value schedule
for a particular team member.  To do this, open Team Dashboard window
and select Task and Schedule from the C menu. Open the schedule for
the team project. If you highlight the sub-schedule for a particular
individual, you can click the Filtered Chart button to see graphical
and statistical views of that individual's earned value plan.</p>



<h2><a name="labelFiltering"></a>Analyzing Filtered Data Using Labels</h2>

<p>Although the project planning summary allows you to drill down into
subcomponents in your team plan, sometimes you will have a need to
analyze a subset of data that slices across those hierarchical
boundaries. To support this need, the dashboard has a powerful feature
for analyzing arbitrary subsets of team data based on keywords called
&quot;labels.&quot;</p>

<p>Labels can be associated with tasks using the Work Breakdown
Structure editor. During the team launch, you may not wish to spend
the entire team's time entering these labels. But after the launch is
complete, you might want to open the WBS and attach keywords to
various tasks. This is done by entering values in the &quot;Task
Labels&quot; column on the &quot;Task Details&quot; tab. Each task can
have any number of labels, separated by commas or spaces. Tasks will
inherit the labels of their WBS parent unless you request
otherwise.</p>

<p>After you edit labels and save the Work Breakdown Structure, you
can apply a label filter from any page of your Team Project Plan
Summary. To apply a label filter, click the filter icon that appears
at the top of the plan summary page (<img
src="../Images/icon-filter.png">). A form will be displayed, prompting
you for the label filter expression you wish to use. The syntax of
this expression is similar to familiar search engines like Google; the
form includes an explanation of the syntax.</p>

<p>When you apply the label filter, all the metrics you see in your
customized forms, charts, and reports will be filtered to include only
the tasks that match your filter expression. </p>

<h2>Backing Up Project Data</h2>

<p>Over the course of the project, you should periodically save a backup of
the data in the Team Dashboard (saving a backup each week is recommended).
Just choose C&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Tools&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Save Data Backup
from the main Team Dashboard window.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/team-save-data-backup.png"></p>

<p>If you retain these backups, you can open them later in the Quick
Launcher to see a historical view of the project's progress.</p>

<h2>Importing/Exporting Data</h2>

<p>During the project, the <i>individual dashboard instances</i>
belonging to each team member export metrics data to the shared team
directory. This exported data is then imported into the <i>team
dashboard instance</i> to calculate rolled up team data.</p>

<p>This export/import mechanism is generally fully automatic. The
<i>individual instances</i> automatically export their data each
night, and each time they are shut down. The <i>team instance</i>
checks for new data every ten minutes, and imports any new data it
finds. As a result, you generally will not need to interact with the
export/import mechanism.</p>

<p>At times, however, you may wish to have a team member correct a
piece of erroneous data and quickly see the change reflected in the
team rollup. At these times, you can ask the individual to select
Export My Data Now from the script menu in their personal dashboard
instance. Once their export is complete, you can select Import All
Data Now from the script menu in the team dashboard instance.</p>

<p>In addition, if you are using task dependencies to coordinate work
between individuals, then you should open the team dashboard at least
once daily. This will allow the team dashboard to recompute the
completion status of dependent tasks, and communicate this data to
individual dashboard instances.</p>

<p>Finally, when the team project is complete and you no longer expect
individuals to be collecting project metrics, open the Team Project
Parameters and Settings page and put a check mark in the box labelled,
"Turn off automatic data exports from individual dashboards."  This
will save time for the members of your team.</p>


<h2>Reassigning Tasks</h2>

<p>Workload balancing is an important part of team project
management. When you determine that you need to reassign tasks, take
these steps.</p>

<ol>

<li style='margin-top:6.0pt'>Select the team project in the team
dashboard, and choose Edit Work Breakdown Structure from the script
menu.</li>

<li style='margin-top:6.0pt'>On the Team menu, turn on the Show Bottom
Up Time Panel option.  After individuals have begun collecting actual
data for the project, the colored balancing bars will update to
reflect planned time <i>remaining</i>.  You can use the colored bars
to balance the remaining work, and their end dates will correspond to
the "Replan" dates in each team members earned value schedule.</li>

<li style='margin-top:6.0pt'>Switch to the Task Time tab of the Work
Breakdown Structure Editor. Edit values in the Assigned To column to
reassign the task(s) in question. Save the changes and close the Work
Breakdown Structure Editor.</li>

<li style='margin-top:6.0pt'>Any team member who was affected by the
change should take the following steps:

    <ol type=a>

    <li style='margin-top:4.0pt'>Follow the instructions in the <a
    href="CreateMemberPlans.html#syncWBS">Synchronize Work Breakdown
    Structure</a> help topic.  The synchronization logic will display
    a list of items added; review this list to ensure that the
    expected changes were made.</li>

    <li style='margin-top:4.0pt'>Open your earned value plan in the
    Task and Schedule dialog. For each newly assigned task, enter your
    best estimate of the task time remaining in the Planned Time (PT)
    column.</li>

    </ol></li>

</ol>

<h2>Using the Quick Launcher</h2>

<p>When you install the Process Dashboard, it creates a shortcut that
opens your own personal dashboard instance (and possibly a second
shortcut to open the team dashboard).  Sometimes, however, you need to
look at data from a different dashboard. For example, the quality
manager may need to look at data collected by a single individual, or
the team coach may need to view the team plan from a remote
location. The Quick Launcher makes this possible. If you select the
Tools for Team Leaders option during installation, a Process Dashboard
Quick Launcher shortcut will be created for your use.</p>

<p>Individuals and teams can create data backup files by opening their
personal or team dashboard, and choosing C&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Tools&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Save Data Backup. Drag-and-drop a
data backup file onto the Quick Launcher window, and a dashboard
window will open displaying the data exactly as it appeared when the
backup was made.</p>

<p>For more information on the creation and use of data backups, see
the <a href="../../help/Topics/AdvancedTopics/BackupData.html">data
backup</a> help topic.</p>
