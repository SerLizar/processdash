<H1>Using the hierarchy editor</h1>
<P>The hierarchy editor allows you to create a work breakdown structure for 
your work, and also defines the process elements that will be used for a 
given software project. The hierarchy editor can be opened by selecting the
"Hierarchy" option on the <a href="../Execution/ConfigureMenu.html">configure
menu</a>.</P>

<P>Its basic function is to allow creation and deletion of nodes in a project 
tree.  You can create any arbitrary node structure to organize the different 
types of projects you are working on, and add project templates to the tree 
from the template files provided.</p>

<p><center><img src="../../Images/HierarchyEditorStart.png"></center></p>

<P>When the hierarchy editor is started, it looks more or less like this.  In 
the screen shot shown, some child nodes have already been defined under both 
"Project" and "Non Project".</p>

<P>When the little tree control is pointing to the right, it indicates that 
the node can be expanded.  Clicking the tree control will cause the expansion 
of the tree.  When the control is pointing down, it indicates that the node 
is showing its expansion and can be collapsed.</p>

<P>The File menu provides the choices of Close, Save, and Revert.  Their 
functionality is pretty self-explanatory:  Close closes the editor, Save 
saves the changes to the dashboard project tree, and Revert will revert the 
project tree back to the state of the last save or to when the editor was 
opened.</p>

<P>The Edit menu provides some rudimentary editing control on the project 
hierarchy.  It provides the choices of <B>Delete</B>, <B>Move Up</B>, <B>Move
Down</B>, <B>Cut</B>, <B>Paste</B>, <B>Add Node</B>, and <B> Add Template</B>.</P>

<P><B>Delete</B> will allow the deletion of a portion of the project tree.  It deletes the selected node and all its children from the tree.&nbsp;
Be careful; deleted nodes and projects cannot be revived once you save your
changes.&nbsp; Deleted projects will no longer contribute to your
historical data.&nbsp; Therefore, you probably don't want to delete
projects unless they contain no real data.&nbsp; If you find that many
historical projects are cluttering up your hierarchy, your best strategy is
to create a node in your hierarchy called &quot;Archived Projects,&quot;
then use <B>Cut</B> and <B>Paste</B> to move completed projects there.</p>

<P><B>Move Up</B> and <B>Move Down</B> alter the relative position of the
selected node in the tree.&nbsp; The selected node will still have the same
parent, but it will appear earlier or later in the list of children for
that parent. Since the <A HREF="UsingTaskSchedule.html">task and schedule</A>
feature assumes that tasks will be performed in hierarchy order, <B>Move Up</B>
and <B>Move Down</B> can help rearrange nodes so they appear in the order
you plan to work on them.</p>

<P><B>Cut</B> and <B>Paste</B> can be used to move a node / project from
one part of the tree to another. Simply highlight the node or project you
wish to move, and choose <B>Cut</B>.&nbsp; Then highlight the new parent
for the node or project, and choose <B>Paste</B>.&nbsp; The &quot;cut&quot;
node (and all it children) will be relocated underneath the new parent. You
can then use <B>Move Up</B> and <B>Move Down</B> to reposition the node
relative to its siblings.</p>

<P><B>Add Node</B> allows insertion of nodes into the tree. Nodes created
in this way serve two general purposes:&nbsp;</p>

<OL>
  <LI>They behave like &quot;folders&quot;, which can contain other nodes
    and/or projects.&nbsp; This allows you to add organization to your work
    projects.</LI>
  <LI>They can be used to track time for process-less tasks like
    &quot;reading email.&quot; If your employer requires you to track your
    time for tasks like these, you can create an entire hierarchy of such
    nodes for time tracking purposes.&nbsp; These nodes will <B><U>not</U></B>
    interfere with your historical PSP project data - they will not
    contribute toward &quot;To Date&quot; calculations and they will not
    appear in PROBE linear regressions.</LI>
</OL>

<P>  Actual projects 
themselves should <em>NOT</em> be added in this way, but should be added via
<B>Add Template</B>.  The <B> Add Node</B> menu brings up a cascading second menu that 
provides the choices of <B>Above</B>, <B>Below</B>, and <B> As Child</B>.  Again, these are pretty 
self-explanatory: <B>  Above</B> will add a node to the tree as a sibling to the 
selected node, and will place it above the selected node; <B> Below</B> will also add 
a sibling node, but will place it below the selected node; <B> As Child</B> will add 
a node as a child of the selected node.</p>

<P><B>Add Template</B> allows insertion of a process template into the tree.  Use
this choice when you are ready to define a project.  The <B> Add Template</B> menu
brings up a cascading second menu that provides choices among the various 
defined processes.  By default, the 7 PSP process levels are provided, along 
with three others: <a 
href="../Overview/ProcessScripts.html#generic">Generic</a>, <a
href="../Overview/ProcessScripts.html#timer">Timer</a>, and <A
HREF="../AdvancedTopics/MultipleToDateData.html">Rollup PSP Data</A>.  If you have added 
any add-on process sets, other choices will appear as well.  For more 
information about the processes and their scripts, see the <a
href="../Overview/ProcessScripts.html">process scripts</A> help topic.</p>

<P>When you insert a project template into the hierarchy, it will initially
have a generic name like &quot;PSP2.1&quot;. You should feel free to change
its name immediately to something more descriptive. (To make dashboard
operation clear, this help document often displays projects with names like
&quot;PSP0&quot;, but such names are neither required nor expected for
actual use.)</p>

<P>Any node in the project hierarchy can be renamed except for the process
elements themselves (i.e. Planning, Design, Code, etc.).  To rename a node,
click the node once to select it, then wait a moment and click it again to go
into edit mode.  The name will appear as a text entry.  You can hit return to
finish changing the name, or escape to cancel the name change. Node names
cannot contain the '/' character.</p>

<h2>Process templates</h2>
<P>When a process template is added, all the process phase elements that are 
defined for that process will be automatically added as children.</p>

<p><center><img src="../../Images/HierarchyEditorShowAddedPSP0.png"></center></p>

<P>These process phases cannot be edited in any way (with a couple 
exceptions).  If a process phase is selected and the Edit menu is clicked, 
the menu will show all entries greyed out and disabled.  This is to protect 
the integrity of the processes themselves.</p>

<h2>Processes PSP0 - PSP1.1</h2>
<P>PSP processes PSP0 through PSP1.1 do not provide for design or code 
reviews, as those improvements are introduced in PSP level 2.  However, the 
dashboard will allow you to add design and or code reviews to these low level 
PSP processes if you choose.  If you pick on a project that was defined from 
the PSP0, PSP0.1, PSP1, or PSP1.1 process templates and then choose the "Add
Template" menu you will see Design Review and Code Review choices.  Either of
these can be added to the process.  They will be automatically inserted in the
correct places in the process phase order.</p>

<p><center><img src="../../Images/HierarchyEditorShowPSP0Reviews.png"></center></p>

<p>Once you insert a Design Review or Code Review phase, it will appear in
the process scripts and forms for the project.&nbsp; If you later change
your mind and decide you don't want the review phase after all, you can
highlight it and choose <B>Delete</B> from the Edit menu.</p>

<a name="cyclic"></a><h2>The PSP3 process</h2>
<P>The PSP3 process is a <B> cyclic</B> development process.  As such, it provides a 
basic structure for the whole project and also provides the ability to add 
development cycles.  When a PSP3 process is added to the hierarchy, it will have the basic skeletal structure defined (Planning, High Level
Design, 
High Level Design Review, and Postmortem phases), along with one PSP3
cycle.</p>

<p><center><img src="../../Images/HierarchyEditorShowEmptyPSP3.png" width="308" height="350"></center></p>

<P>Once you decide upon your cyclical development strategy, you should
create additional cycles underneath the PSP3 project. Each of these cycles will contain the other PSP3 process phases 
(Design, Design Review, Code, Code Review, Compile, Test, and Reassessment).  
The PSP3 cycles are added just like the PSP3 project itself, via the "Add
Template" menu.  When a PSP3 based project is selected and the Edit menu is
chosen, the Add Template menu item will have only one available choice:
PSP3cycle.  The cycle will be placed appropriately before the Postmortem step.
You can input as many cycles as you would like in this manner.</p>
