<h1>Create Quality Plan</h1>
<b>(TSP Launch Meeting No. 5)</b>

<p>Because of the way the dashboard currently handles team quality
data, it is necessary to <a href="CreateMemberPlans.html">create
individual team member plans</a> before you can view the team quality
plan.  This means that you should most likely alter the launch
schedule, folding launch meeting No. 6 back into launch meeting
No.4.</p>

<p>Once you have successfully <a
href="ViewBottomUpPlan.html">validated the bottom-up team plan</a>,
you may proceed with the steps below.</p>

<h2>Workflow-Driven Quality Plans</h2>

<p>During planning, teams <a href="EditWorkflows.html">create workflows</a> to
define their development process.  If your team has created workflows, applied
them to components in the WBS, assigned those tasks to individuals, and had
the individuals perform a "Sync to WBS," you can view quality plans for each
workflow in use.</p>

<p>To view the quality plan for a workflow, open the project's Rollup Plan
Summary report, <a href="TeamLeaderProcess.html#project">navigate to the
"Workflow Summary" section</a>, and select the workflow you wish to
analyze.</p>

<p>Several of the tables and charts in the "Workflow Summary" section will
depict the number of defects that the team expects to inject and remove in
each phase, and the number of defects that will still be present in the
components after the workflow is complete.  If these values do not measure up
to your team's quality goals, you can 
<a href="EditWorkflows.html#qualityParams">edit the quality parameters</a> for
the workflow, save the changes, and refresh this report.</p>

<p><i>Note:</i> workflow-driven quality plans were introduced in Process
Dashboard version 2.5.  If you wish to view the quality plan for an older
project, it may be necessary to open that team project's WBS at least once and
save a trivial change.  (This step gives the WBS Editor a chance to add
default quality parameter values to the project workflows.)</p>


<h2>Overarching Quality Plans</h2>

<p>The workflow-driven quality plans described above are informative because
they are aligned to the custom processes the team has defined.  But often,
workflows only cover a portion of the end-to-end development process: for
example, a team might have separate workflows for requirements vs
implementation. In this case, it can be helpful to see a quality model that
covers the entire development process, to estimate how many defects will
remain in the final delivered product.</p>

<p>One powerful and flexible way to accomplish this is to create a workflow
that describes the entire, end-to-end development process. Then,
<a href="TeamLeaderProcess.html#workflowMapping">map all of the other
workflows</a> to this end-to-end workflow.  After configuring those mappings,
view the quality plan for the end-to-end workflow.</p>

<p>But for most projects, a much simpler approach is possible. The steps in
every workflow are already mapped to the phases in the team project's
<a href="MetricsCollectionFramework.html">metrics collection framework</a>; so
the dashboard can automatically generate an end-to-end quality plan based on
those framework phases.</p>

<p>The framework-driven quality parameters can be edited on the Team Project
Parameters and Settings page, which can be opened by clicking the appropriate
item on the main Team Dashboard window.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/team-settings-page.png"></p>

<p>This page includes:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>A Quality Profile Parameters section for setting PQI
    parameters.</li>

    <li>An Estimated Phase Yields section for entering the yields your
    team plans to achieve in each quality phase.</li>

    <li>An Estimated Defect Injection Rates section for entering
    estimated project defect injection rates.</li>

    </ul>

<p>Follow the guidance provided in the TSP process to create these
estimates.</p>


<p>Using the quality parameters entered on the page above, and data
from your team's project plan, the dashboard will calculate a quality
plan for your project and include it as part of the overall project
plan. To view this quality plan, switch to the Team Dashboard window,
select the team project from the tree on the left, and click the
Rollup Plan Summary option in the list on the right.  The rollup plan
summary will appear in your web browser.</p>

<p>Next, click the "Quality Summary" section from the list on the left.
This will display a quality plan based on the phases in the metrics
collection framework.  You can drill down and see the quality plans for
various project subcomponents by clicking on the 
(<img src="../Images/icon-hier-nav.png">) icon.</p>


<p>If the calculated quality metrics do not meet your team's quality
goals, you may edit the project quality parameters described above, in
keeping with the guidance in the TSP process.  To simplify this task,
open two browser windows: one containing the project parameters page,
and the other containing the calculated quality plan.  As you edit the
quality parameters, calculated values (displayed as numbers in grey
boxes) will recalculate automatically.  To update views of graphical
charts, you will need to refresh the page manually.</p>
