<H1>Navigating the hierarchy menus</H1>

<P>The dashboard attempts to keep itself as small as possible to allow the bulk 
of precious screen real estate to be used for the actual business of software 
development.  As different sections of the project tree are selected via the 
hierarchy menus, the dashboard will automatically resize itself to accomodate 
the menu depth necessary to show the chosen process phase.</P>

<P>The hierarchy menus are the way you choose the current working project.  
This example shows the dashboard ready to work on the Design phase of a 
PSP0 project.  The hierarchy menus show each level in the current project 
tree all the way down to the current phase.</P>

<P>To better illustrate navigation with the hierarchy menus, a fake set of projects will be shown.  The project tree is shown below in a screenshot from the hierarchy editor.  For more information on putting together a project hierarchy and the use of the hierarchy editor see the <a href="../Planning/Planning.html">Planning a project</a> and <a href="../Planning/UsingHierarchyEditor.html">Using the hierarchy editor</a> help topics.</P>

   <P>To better illustrate navigation with the hierarchy menus, this fake 
   set of projects will be used.  The project tree is shown in a screenshot 
   from the hierarchy editor.  For more information on putting together a 
   project hierarchy and the use of the hierarchy editor see the <a 
   href="../Planning/Planning.html">Planning a project</a> and <a 
   href="../Planning/UsingHierarchyEditor.html">Using the hierarchy 
   editor</a> help topics.</P>

   <P>This project hierarchy shows two top level project categories: 
   "Project" and "Non Project".  These are the two categories given as 
   default when the dashboard is first run.  Under "Project" there are two 
   projects defined: "PSP0" and "Web project" along with a hierarchy node: 
   "Palm".  Presumably this developer will be doing several projects in the 
   future that fall under the logical category of "Palm".  At this point only 
   one is shown: "Palm DB".</P>

   <P>The phases shown under each project are whatever phases are defined for 
   the process that the project is based upon.  In this example, the "PSP0" 
   and "Palm DB" projects were created from the PSP0 template.  The "Web 
   project" was created from the PSP2.1 template.</P>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table></p>

<P>When the first hierarchy menu is selected, it will show all the entries in 
the project hierarchy that are defined at that level.  In this case it shows 
the two default nodes "Project" and "Non Project".</P> 

<img src="../../Images/HierarchyMenu1.jpg">

<P>Selecting the second hierarchy menu shows the entries defined at that 
level under the selection from the first menu.  In this case, the user has 
selected "Project" on the first menu, so the second menu shows the children 
of "Project" in the project hierarchy.</p>

<img src="../../Images/HierarchyMenu2.jpg">

<P>Selecting any menu in the set of hierarchy menus will show the entries 
defined as children under the selection on the menu to its left.  This final 
example shows the PSP 2.1 process phases that are defined for the "Web 
project".</p>
