<H1>Using the hierarchy editor</h1>
<P>The hierarchy editor allows you to create a work breakdown structure for 
your work, and also defines the process elements that will be used for a 
given software project. The hierarchy editor can be opened by selecting the
"Hierarchy Editor" option on the <a
href="../Execution/ConfigureMenu.html">configure menu</a>.</P>

<P>Its basic function is to allow creation and deletion of nodes in a project 
tree.  You can create any arbitrary node structure to organize the different 
types of projects you are working on, and add project templates to the tree 
from the template files provided.</p>

<p><img src="../../Images/HierarchyEditorStart.png"></p>

<P>When the hierarchy editor is started, it looks more or less like this.  In 
the screen shot shown, some child nodes have already been defined under both 
"Project" and "Non Project".</p>

<P>When the little tree control is pointing to the right, it indicates that 
the node can be expanded.  Clicking the tree control will cause the expansion 
of the tree.  When the control is pointing down, it indicates that the node 
is showing its expansion and can be collapsed.</p>

<P>The File menu provides the choices of Close, Save, and Revert.  Their 
functionality is pretty self-explanatory:  Close closes the editor, Save 
saves the changes to the dashboard project tree, and Revert will revert the 
project tree back to its state when the editor was opened.</p>

<P>The Edit menu provides some rudimentary editing control on the project 
hierarchy.  It provides the choices of Delete, Add Node, and Add Template.</P>

<P>Delete will allow the deletion of a portion of the project tree.  It deletes the selected node and all its children from the tree.</p>

<P>Add Node allows insertion of nodes into the tree.  Use this choice when 
you wish to add organization to your work projects.  Actual projects 
themselves should <em>NOT</em> be added in this way, but should be added via 
"Add Template".  The Add Node menu brings up a cascading second menu that 
provides the choices of Above, Below, and As Child.  Again, these are pretty 
self-explanatory:  Above will add a node to the tree as a sibling to the 
selected node, and will place it above the selected node; Below will also add 
a sibling node, but will place it below the selected node; As Child will add 
a node as a child of the selected node.</p>

<P>Add Template allows insertion of a process template into the tree.  Use
this choice when you are ready to define a project.  The Add Template menu
brings up a cascading second menu that provides choice for the various defined
processes.  The 7 PSP process levels are provided, along with two others: <a
href="../Overview/ProcessScripts.html#generic">Generic</a> and <a
href="../Overview/ProcessScripts.html#timer">Timer</a>.  For more information
about the processes and their scripts, see the <a
href="../Overview/ProcessScripts.html">process scripts</A> help topic.</p>

<P>Any node in the project hierarchy can be renamed except for the process
elements themselves (i.e. Planning, Design, Code, etc.).  To rename a node,
click the node once to select it, then wait a moment and click it again to go
into edit mode.  The name will appear as a text entry.  You can hit return to
finish changing the name, or escape to cancel the name change.</p>

<h2>Process templates</h2>
<P>When a process template is added, all the process phase elements that are 
defined for that process will be automatically added as children.</p>

<p><img src="../../Images/HierarchyEditorShowAddedPSP0.png"></p>

<P>These process phases cannot be edited in any way (with a couple 
exceptions).  If a process phase is selected and the Edit menu is clicked, 
the menu will show all entries greyed out and disabled.  This is to protect 
the integrity of the processes themselves.</p>

<h2>Processes PSP0 - PSP1.1</h2>
<P>PSP processes PSP0 through PSP1.1 do not provide for design or code 
reviews, as those improvements are introduced in PSP level 2.  However, the 
dashboard will allow you to add design and or code reviews to these low level 
PSP processes if you choose.  If you pick on a project that was defined from 
the PSP0, PSP0.1, PSP1, or PSP1.1 process templates and then choose the "Add
Template" menu you will see Design Review and Code Review choices.  Either of
these can be added to the process.  They will be automatically inserted in the
correct places in the process phase order.</p>

<h2>The PSP3 process</h2>
<P>The PSP3 process is a cyclic development process.  As such, it provides a 
basic structure for the whole project and also provides the ability to add 
development cycles.  When a PSP3 process is added to the hierarchy, it will 
only have the basic skeletal structure defined (Planning, High Level Design, 
High Level Design Review, and Postmortem phases).</p>

<p><img src="../../Images/HierarchyEditorShowEmptyPSP3.png"></p>

<P>The next step in defining a PSP3 project will be to add one or more 
cycles.  Each of these cycles will contain the other PSP3 process phases 
(Design, Design Review, Code, Code Review, Compile, Test, and Reassessment).  
The PSP3 cycles are added just like the PSP3 project itself, via the "Add
Template" menu.  When a PSP3 based project is selected and the Edit menu is
chosen, the Add Template menu item will have only one available choice:
PSP3cycle.  The cycle will be placed appropriately before the Postmortem step.
You can input as many cycles as you would like in this manner.</p>

<h2>About editing the tree</h2>
<P>Currently, the hierarchy editor is pretty limited in what it can do.  If 
you go through and rename various nodes in the hierarchy after the dashboard 
has already measured information for them, you are likely to lose that 
information.  A much improved version of the editor is planned for a future 
release.  In the meantime, you shouldn't mess around with any parts of the 
project tree that have already recorded data.</p>
