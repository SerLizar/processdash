<h1>Using the Dashboard During a Team Project Launch</h1>

<p>You will make extensive use of the Team Dashboard during the
project launch. Thus, if the Team Dashboard is not already running,
you should start it using the appropriately named shortcut on the team
leader's computer.</p>

<p>Many of the tools you will need during the launch are provided in
the script menu for the team project. To open this menu, select the
team project and click the down arrow to the right of the Script
Button.  (Throughout the rest of this document, this menu will be
referred to as &quot;the script menu for the team project.&quot;)</p>

<p>If you prefer, you can also open these tools from a web browser;
just choose Team Project Tools and Settings from the menu described
above. The Team Project Tools and Settings page will open in your Web
browser.</p>

<p>In particular, the web browser approach is required during
multi-team launches when several teams are launching in parallel. With
the Team Dashboard running on a master computer, each team lead can
point a web browser to the settings page for their project and access
the tools they need for the launch. A URL is provided at the bottom of
each Settings page for this purpose.</p>
