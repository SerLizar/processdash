Wizard.Intro_HTML=\
	Size and time estimating are complex skills, best developed through \
	experience.  As you strive to improve your estimating skills, your \
	primary goal should be estimating accuracy.\
	\n\n\
	<p>The Proxy Based Estimating process (PROBE) includes statistical \
	methods that can help you to improve your estimating accuracy over \
	time. These methods analyze your past estimating performance, and \
	attempt to mathematically remove any consistent estimating bias found.\
	\n\n\
	<p>This wizard will help you to perform this portion of the PROBE \
	process.  Keep in mind that:<ul>\
	\n\n\
	<li>PROBE is not magic - you must actively exercise your engineering \
 	judgement to ensure that you produce sensible estimates.\
	\n\n\
	<li>The PROBE methods implicitly assume that the project you are \
	currently estimating is similar to the projects you have completed \
	in the past.  If this is not true, use PROBE-generated estimates \
	with caution.\
	\n\n\
	<li>PROBE works best when you are consistent in your use of the Size \
	Estimating Template.\

Wizard.Input.Planning_Error.2.Planning_Project_Complete_HTML=\
	You have marked the planning phase <b>and</b> this project complete,
Wizard.Input.Planning_Error.3_Middle_HTML=\
	which indicates to the dashboard that you should no \
	longer be performing planning activities like PROBE.  If you \
	were to use the PROBE wizard at this point, some of your data \
	calculations would be incorrect.\

Wizard.Input.Input_Missing_Error_HTML_FMT=\
	The PROBE process uses {0} as the basis for generating final \

Wizard.Input.Input_Missing_Error_Instr_HTML_FMT=\
	Press the Finish button to close this window, then use the Size \
	Estimating Template to generate the {0}.

Wizard.Input.Input_Mismatch_Error=\
	The PROBE Wizard uses Estimated Proxy Size as the basis for \
	generating final estimates for size and time.  However, after you \
	last ran the PROBE Wizard, you modified estimates on the Size \
	Estimating Template, causing the Estimated Proxy Size to change.  \
	Your current PROBE estimates are based upon the old value of \
	Estimated Proxy Size. To resolve this problem, you should \
	double-check the values in the Size Estimating Template, then run \
	the PROBE Wizard again.
Wizard.Input.Input_Mismatch_Error_HTML_FMT=\
	The PROBE process uses {0} as the basis for generating final \
	estimates for size and time.  When you performed the PROBE \
	process, your {0} was {1}.  However, after you ran PROBE, \
	you altered your {0}, and it is now {2}.  Your current PROBE \
	estimates are based upon the old value of {0}.  To resolve \
	this problem, you should verify that your {0} is correct, \
	then run the PROBE Wizard again.

Wizard.Input.Provide_Input_HTML_FMT=\
	The PROBE process uses {0} as the basis for generating final \
	estimates for size and time.  Please use your defined process \
	(using a Size Estimating Template as appropriate) to generate the \
	{0} for this project, and enter it in the field below\:
Wizard.Input.Verify_Input_HTML_FMT=\
	From your Size Estimating Template, your {0} is {1}.
Wizard.Input.Verify_Input_Instr_HTML_FMT=\
	If you want to alter your {0}, you should return to the Size \

Wizard.Check.Productivity.High_HTML_FMT=\

Wizard.Check.Productivity.Low_HTML_FMT=\

Wizard.Tutorial.Outlier_Title=Outliers
Wizard.Tutorial.Outlier_HTML=\
	The word <span>outlier</span> is a statistical term for an unusual \
	data point.  When you have a collection of historic data points and \
	one of those data points is <b>very</b> different from the rest, it \
	may be an outlier.\
	\n\n\
	<p>Identifying outliers is not a simple task.  You can't just look \
	at the data points and throw out the ones that don't fall along the \
	best-fit line.  You can generally only decide that a point is an \
	outlier if you are familiar with the project in question, and you \
	know that something unusual happened on that project to skew the \
	data point.\
	\n\n\
	<p>For example, if your computer were to crash halfway through a \
	project, and you were forced to start over, that project would likely \
	end up taking much longer than expected. The resulting data point \
	could fairly be considered to be an outlier.  On the other hand, \
	making a bad estimate is <b>not</b> an unusual occurrence, so you \
	can't throw out data points simply because your estimate was bad.\
	\n\n\
	<p>If you recall that unusual circumstances affected a particular \
	project, you can choose to discard that data point, to prevent it \
	from skewing PROBE analyses. In general, however, it is best not to \
	overuse this privilege. For more information, see page 507 of the \
	book, <i>A&nbsp;Discipline for Software Engineering</i>.

Wizard.Tutorial.Regress_HTML_FMT=\
	{0} uses historical data from your completed projects to help \
	generate an accurate estimate.  It draws a chart using \
	{1} on the horizontal axis and {2} on the vertical axis, and \
	plots a point for each completed project. Then it draws the \
	best-fit line for those points, and uses it to translate your \
	{3} into {4}.  Finally, it calculates a range around the new \
	{4} within which the {2} value is likely to fall, based on the \
	accuracy of the past estimates and the distance of the new {1} \
	from the past ones.

Wizard.Tutorial.Average_HTML_FMT=\
	{0} uses historical data from your completed projects to help \
	generate an accurate estimate.  It draws a chart using \
	{1} on the horizontal axis and {2} on the vertical axis, and \
	plots a point for each completed project. Then it draws a line \
	which goes through the point (0,&nbsp;0) and depicts the average \
	ratio between {1} and {2} to date.  Finally, it uses this line to \
	translate your {3} into {4}.

Wizard.Tutorial.Manual_HTML_FMT=\
	<b>PROBE Method D for {0}</b> is a <i>manual</i> method for \
	generating an estimate.  When you do not have enough historical \
	data to use the other PROBE Methods, or when the estimates \
	generated by the other PROBE Methods do not seem right to you, \
	<b>PROBE Method D</b> allows you to use your engineering judgement \
	to generate your final estimate manually.

Wizard.Tutorial.Parameters.Title=PROBE Parameters
Wizard.Tutorial.Parameters.Header_HTML=\
	PROBE Methods A, B, and C all draw a line describing some trend in \
	your historical data.  The following parameters describe that line\:
Wizard.Tutorial.Parameters.Footer_HTML=\u0020
Wizard.Tutorial.Parameters.Item_FMT={0}: {1}
Wizard.Tutorial.Parameters.Definition.Beta0_HTML=\
	describes how far away from zero the line is when it crosses the \
	vertical axis.
Wizard.Tutorial.Parameters.Definition.Beta1_HTML=\
	describes the slope, or steepness, of the line.
Wizard.Tutorial.Parameters.Definition.R_Squared_HTML=\
	describes how well your historical data points fall along the line. \
	When r\u00B2 is 0.9 or greater, the line describes your data points \
	very well.  When r\u00B2 is less than 0.5, your data points are too \
	scattered for the line to be meaningful.
Wizard.Tutorial.Parameters.Definition.Significance_HTML=\
	Sometimes data points fall along a line by accident.  The number 1-2p \
	gives the probability that this has occurred. So if 1-2p were 60%, it \
	would mean that there was a 60% chance that your data points just \
	fell along the given line randomly, and only a 40% chance that the \
	line describes some real relationship in your data.
