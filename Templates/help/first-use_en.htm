<div><B><I>Thank you for using the </I><U>Process Dashboard!</U></B></div>

<p>For help and instructions on the use of the Process Dashboard, you can
open the <a href="http://help/QuickOverview">User's&nbsp;Manual</a> at any
time by clicking the "<img src='Images/cmenu.png'>" menu on the main window,
then choosing "Help&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Help&nbsp;Topics."</p>

<p>If this is your first time to run the dashboard, you might benefit from the
<a href="http://help/QuickStart">quick start guide</a>, which provides a
quick walkthrough of dashboard usage.</p>

<p>If you will be participating as a member of a Team Project, contact your
team leader. They will send you a link you can use to join the team project
and create your personal plan.</p>

<p>If you plan to work by yourself (not as a member of a team project),
the first step to using the dashboard is to create a hierarchical work
breakdown structure describing the work you do.  To create this hierarchy,
follow these steps: <ol>

   <li>On the main dashboard window, click the "<img src='Images/cmenu.png'>"
       Menu, and choose "Hierarchy".  The Hierarchy Editor window will appear.<BR>&nbsp;

   <li>Build your hierarchy using commands in the "Edit" menu.  Your hierarchy
       can be built from
       <ul>
       <li>"Nodes" (which are like folders on your hard drive) and
       <li>Templates (which are defined processes for completing a task - for
       example, PSP2.1).
       </ul>
       In general, you will want to create a hierarchy of Nodes describing the
       various projects/subprojects you support, then add templates underneath
       these nodes describing the lowest-level tasks to be done.<BR>&nbsp;

   <li>You don't have to create your complete work breakdown structure right
       now - you can always come back and add nodes and templates to your
       hierarchy later.  When you have finished editing your hierarchy, choose
       "Save" from the "File" menu.

</ol></p>
