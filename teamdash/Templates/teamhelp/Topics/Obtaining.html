<h1>Obtaining the Process Dashboard with Team Features</h1>

<p>The Process Dashboard is a powerful and flexible tool for software
process automation, released under the terms of the GNU General Public
License. By automating and simplifying metrics collection and
analysis, the Process Dashboard makes it easier to use high-maturity
processes such as the Personal Software Process<sup> (SM)</sup> and the
Team Software Process<sup> (SM)</sup>.</p>

<p>The Process Dashboard contains an embedded process engine which
provides unprecedented integration of metrics data with process
scripts, forms, and other documents. This engine reads process
definitions as simple XML, HTML, and text files, and provides a user
interface which helps individuals to use the process.  Because
process definitions are not hard-coded into the application, anyone
can create a new process definition to use with the
dashboard. Ready-made process definitions can also be installed if
desired - including process frameworks that support high-maturity
teams, as described in this document.</p>

<p>The open source Process Dashboard can be downloaded by
visiting:</p>

<p>Additional process definitions, documentation, and other materials
can be downloaded from:</p>

<p>You may receive this installation program either as a CD-ROM, a ZIP
file, or a JAR file. If you receive the ZIP file, you can unzip it and
burn the contents onto a CD-ROM; although this step is not required,
it may simplify the task of installing the dashboard on team members'
computers.</p>

<p>The installer program doubles as an <i>upgrader</i> for previous
versions of the dashboard. Therefore, if individuals have an earlier
version of the dashboard installed on their computer (for example,
from taking a PSP<sup> (SM)</sup> course), they can safely perform
this installation process to upgrade the software.  It <b>is not</b>
necessary to uninstall the dashboard before upgrading.</p>
