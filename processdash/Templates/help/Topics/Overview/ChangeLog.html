<H1>Change History</H1>

<h2>Features new in version 1.12</h2>

<ul>

<li>Since version 1.7, the dashboard has included a team metrics collection
framework called "Software Systems Development." To avoid any potential
copyright violations, that metrics framework has used a different set of
process phases than the TSP<sup>(SM)</sup>.  Beginning with version 1.12,
we are happy to announce that the Software Engineering Institute has
granted us permission to distribute a TSP-compatible metrics framework.
This new framework will reduce the learning curve for TSP teams as they
first begin to use the Process Dashboard.</li>

<li>Process Dashboard installers are now provided to support the assignment
sequence of the PSP<sup>(SM)</sup> Fundamentals and Advanced courses.</li>

<li>It is now possible to attach HTTP URLs to the elements in a Common Team
Workflow.  This can be used to associate organizational process scripts or
wiki pages that describe the steps in a workflow.  (Note: this feature is
only available for team projects that are created using Process Dashboard
1.12 or later.)</li>

<li>Data from earned value schedules can now be exported to Microsoft
Project in the new MS Office XML format.</li>

<li>The "Status of Team Member Metrics" page has always displayed the date
when each team member last exported their metrics.  Now, it also displays
the date they last performed a "Sync to WBS" operation.</li>

<li>In the past, the components and tasks in a rolled-up team EV schedule
would sometimes not appear in the same order that they appear in the WBS.
The reporting logic has been enhanced so the EV schedule will follow the
WBS element ordering more closely.</li>

<li>Charts have been added to the PSP project plan summary forms to display
time, defects, and PQI.</li>

<li>In the WBS Editor Team Member List, the column headers now display dates
in a locale-sensitive manner for non-US teams.</li>

<li>Teams can optionally choose to have the WBS Editor prompt for read-only
mode on startup.  (This option can be controlled on a project-by-project
basis.)</li>

<li>In the WBS Editor and in the EV reports, when a percent complete number
is greater than 99.5% but less than 100%, it will be rounded down to 99%.
This helps to avoid confusion, since 100% will now only appear for tasks
that are truly complete.</li>

<li>The EV Report will now display a warning message if tasks have been
marked complete in the future, or if time has been logged in the future.
This can help in the troubleshooting of problems caused by data entry
typos.</li>

<li>On the Weekly EV Report, the "Tasks Completed Last Week" table now
displays a total row.</li>

<li>Some international dashboard users have seen problems with corruption
of accented characters in the Team Dashboard.  A new feature is provided in
the Preferences dialog to help those teams.</li>

<li>In the personal dashboard, the Team Project Tools and Settings page has
previously included a checkbox to "Include all WBS components and documents
in sync operations."  This checkbox represented obsolete functionality, and
now only causes problems when individuals enable it out of curiosity.  To
avoid those problems, the feature has been removed.</li>

<li>Teams that have upgraded to a recent version of the Code Collaborator
server were finding that defect types were no longer being transferred by
the "Import from Code Collaborator" feature.  This problem has been
corrected.</li>

<li>A bug was affecting the date-based filtering of entries in the Time Log
(for example, when you request to view time log entries for "Today").  This
bug has been corrected.</li>

<li>The Perforce LOC counter can now count LOC in integration changelists.
This functionality is designed to support the workflow where an individual
makes changes in a personal sandbox, then integrates those changes back to
the main line of development.  In that case, the individual can point the
LOC counter at the changelist where the files were integrated back to the
mainline, and receive a LOC count of the effective changes.</li>

<li>Installers are now available in EXE format for use on Windows systems.
These EXEs can simplify the installation process for users who previously
encountered problems with filesystem permissions in Windows Vista.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Features new in version 1.11</h2>

<ul>

<li>URLs can now be attached to any component or task in the dashboard.
Just use the WBS Editor or the dashboard to edit the free-text note
associated with a particular item, and enter a URL within the body of the
note.  The dashboard will discover the embedded URLs and add them to the
script menu for easy, one-click access.</li>

<li>A new Preferences dialog is available on the "C &gt; Tools" menu,
providing easy access to the most common configuration settings.</li>

<li>Several enhancements were made to the usability of the WBS Editor:

  <ul>

  <li>Pressing the Enter key in the WBS Editor typically inserts a new
      task.  A new button is now provided to toggle this behavior on and
      off.</li>

  <li>The WBS Editor now uses a strikethrough font to highlight tasks that
      are 100% complete.</li>

  <li>A "New Tab" button is now displayed, providing one-click access to
      the functionality on the WBS Editor "Tabs" menu.</li>

  </ul></li>


<li>Significant enhancements have been made to the PSP materials in the
Process Dashboard:

  <ul>

  <li>The PSP scripts and forms in the Process Dashboard have been updated
      to match the materials in the 2005 book, <i>A&nbsp;Self-Improvement
      Process for Software Engineers</i>.  (Up to now, they have been based
      upon the 1995 book, <i>A&nbsp;Discipline for Software
      Engineering</i>.)  With this change, the scripts, forms, and wizards
      now match the materials and terminology used in the most recent PSP
      courses from the SEI.  (Note: the PSP materials are now released as a
      separate download from the Process Dashboard.)</li>

  <li>On the Size Estimating Template, the estimated size of an "added
      part" will be computed automatically after an engineer estimates its
      type, relative size, and number of items.  Engineers can create their
      own size-per-item lookup tables in support of this
      functionality.</li>

  <li>On the Size Estimating Template, an interactive chart now appears to
      help engineers visualize the relationship between estimated base,
      added, deleted, and modified size.  Engineers can drag handles on a
      slider to visually estimate base additions, modifications, and
      deletions as a percentage of base program size.</li>

  <li>The PSP Project Plan Summary forms are now customizable, in support
      of personal process improvement goals.</li>

  </ul></li>

<li>Significant changes have been made in support of the PSP for Engineers
courses:

  <ul>

  <li>A new "Grading Helper" has been created for PSP Instructors.  After
      installing a special "PSP Instructor" add-on, this grading helper
      will appear in the script menu for PSP course assignments.  The
      grading helper automates many of the data analysis tasks and
      consistency checks that are part of the grading process.  Instructors
      can customize the form to match their grading preferences.</li>

  <li>The dashboard traditionally baselines "Planned" and "To Date" project
      data at specific points during a project.  Although this strategy is
      very helpful for the planning and tracking of real-world project
      work, it becomes an impediment to the quick-turnaround learning
      objectives of the PSP course, because the "frozen" values prevent
      students from correcting errors in earlier assignments.  To address
      this problem, this "freezing" mechanism has now been disabled for the
      assignments in the PSP course.</li>

  <li>It is now much easier for students to create the quality plan for
      their first PSP2 assignment.</li>

  <li>Error messages now appear on the Project Plan Summary form to
      warn engineers about common mistakes.  For example, if students
      forget to enter the actual size of Program 1, an error message
      will appear on their Program 2 Project Plan Summary form.</li>

  </ul></li>

<li>When you first create a team project, the Team Project Setup Wizard
prompts you for the name of a directory where team data should be stored.
Later in the project, you may discover that you need to move these files to
a different location on the network.  A new feature makes this
possible.</li>

<li>The dashboard has always included advanced earned value features to
support iterative project planning.  Unfortunately, some teams would
inadvertently trigger these advanced features by choosing a start date in
the future (for example, the week <i>after</i> their project launch).  To
avoid this confusion, the iterative planning feature must now be explicitly
enabled in the "Tools &gt; Schedule Options" dialog of the Task &amp;
Schedule window.</li>

<li>Geographically diverse teams - such as teams split between India and
the United States - would sometimes see inconsistent data in the earned
value reports.  New time-zone awareness logic has been added to address
these problems.</li>

<li>The defect log now includes an "Import from Code Collaborator"
button.  Teams that use Collaborator
(<u class="url">http://smartbear.com/</u>) can take advantage of this
new import feature to reduce double-entry of defect data.</li>

</ul>


<h2>Features new in version 1.10</h2>

<ul>

<li>The Process Dashboard is now released under version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.</li>


<li><a name="newStyle"></a>For new team projects, created after the
installation of this update, a new task structure will be used:

  <ul>

  <li>Previously, the process phase of a task (e.g. Planning, Code, Test,
      etc) was recorded via a final "stub" that appeared at the end of each
      task in the hierarchy.  Now, these stubs are no longer created.  This
      change reduces clutter, makes it easier to subdivide existing tasks,
      and reduces the memory usage of the Process Dashboard.</li>

  <li>In a new-style team project, individuals will have a project plan
      summary report similar to the one on the team side: it can be edited
      to include custom charts, reports, and tables of data.</li>

  <li><b>Important:</b> Data from new-style and old-style team projects
      <b>can</b> still be rolled up together into master projects.</li>

  </ul></li>


<li>For a <a href="#newStyle">new-style</a> team project that is underway,
new columns will appear in the Work Breakdown Structure Editor to display
actual metrics:

  <ul class="tight">
  <li>Actual time spent on each task</li>
  <li>Actual completion date</li>
  <li>Percent complete </li>
  <li>Percent spent</li>
  </ul>

Among other things, this makes it possible to see which tasks have been
completed, which are in progress, and which have not yet started.</li>


<li>When changes are made in the WBS, individuals use the "Sync to WBS"
operation to copy those changes into their personal plan.  In a <a
href="#newStyle">new-style</a> team project, the synchronization is now
bidirectional.  When individuals make changes to the following data in
their personal plan, the changes will be propagated back into the WBS
automatically:

  <ul class="tight">
  <li>Changes to the planned time for tasks</li>
  <li>Changes to the planned hours in the schedule</li>
  <li>Changes to task notes/comments</li>
  <li>Changes to the phase type of a task (e.g. Planning, Code, etc.)</li>
  </ul></li>


<li>The colored bars in the WBS Editor are a useful tool for balancing work
between team members.  For a <a href="#newStyle">new-style</a> team project
that is underway, these bars can now be toggled between two modes:

  <ul class="tight">

  <li><u>Show End-to-End Plan</u>: This mode takes all tasks into account.
      The dates calculated for each team member will correspond to the
      "Planned Completion Date" for that individual in their personal
      earned value schedule.</li>

  <li><u>Show Remaining Work</u>: This mode subtracts out tasks that have
      already been completed, as well as effort spent on in-progress work.
      The dates calculated for each team member will correspond to the
      "Replanned Completion Date" for that individual in their personal
      earned value schedule.</li>

  </ul>

The new "Remaining Work" mode is a powerful way to rebalance work during a
relaunch.  Teams can also use it throughout a project iteration to
continually rebalance work.</li>

<li>The Process Dashboard now supports baselines for earned value data.
You can save a baseline for any earned value schedule, then view baseline
metrics in the task list and EV charts.</li>

<li>The WBS Editor now includes support for project milestones:

  <ul class="tight">

  <li>It is possible to define a list of project milestones, and
      optionally enter commit dates</li>

  <li>Each component and/or task in the WBS can be assigned to a
      particular milestone</li>

  <li>Marks appear on the colored balancing bars to indicate when
      each individual could potentially finish their work for each
      milestone</li>

  <li>The colored balancing bars can be configured to balance work
      for the entire project or just for the next milestone(s)</li>

  <li>Future milestones can be marked as "deferred," and the sync
      operation will not copy the associated tasks into team member
      plans.</li>

  </ul></li>

<li id="taskNotes">A new icon on the main toolbar makes it easy to attach
free-text notes to any component or task in the Process Dashboard.  On a
team project, these notes are shared by the team, and accessible in the WBS
Editor.</li>

<li>Play and pause now appear as separate toggle buttons.</li>

<li>A new "timing reminder" feature is available.  This feature can
periodically display pop-up alerts, reminding the user to start or stop
their timer or to change the active task.  <i>(This feature is not enabled
by default, but can be turned on by individuals who wish to use it. To
enable this feature, right-click on the tray icon and choose "Reminder &gt;
Enable Reminder.")</i></li>

<li>The WBS Editor now allows you to enter detailed schedules for each team
member, to include start dates, end dates, and planned time exceptions on
specific weeks.  This information is bidirectionally synchronized with each
individual's personal earned value schedule.</li>

<li>Previously, the WBS Editor would not allow you to assign a task to an
individual until a time estimate had been entered for the task.  Now, it is
possible to assign a task to an individual even while the task's time
estimate is still zero.  Agile project teams may use this feature to
support on-the-fly cost estimation.</li>

<li>The Team Dashboard Users Manual is now included in the dashboard's
searchable online help.</li>

<li>When starting a new project or iteration, you can now bring forward the
data from historical earned value schedules.  As a result, the dashboard
can calculate forecast dates and prediction ranges during a team project
launch, even before any actual data has been collected.</li>

<li>The weekly earned value report now includes a "Tasks In Progress"
section.  This section displays tasks that have been started but not yet
completed, making it easier to spot problems such as overspent tasks.</li>


<li>Historically, "PSP Tasks" were required if a team wanted to capture
planned and actual LOC for their project.  Now, LOC can be captured for
"code" tasks as well.</li>

<li>Installation and operation of the dashboard on Mac OS X is greatly
improved.</li>

<li>On Unix/Linux systems, the default web browser has been changed from
Netscape to Firefox.</li>

</ul>


<h2>Features new in version 1.9</h2>

<ul>

<li>The Process Dashboard now displays an icon in the system tray:

  <ul>

  <li>Users can click on the icon to start/stop the timer, and tell from a
      glance at the icon whether the timer is running.</li>

  <li>The tooltip on the icon displays the active task.  Ctrl-click on the
      icon allows the user to select a new active task.</li>

  <li>The popup menu on the tray icon provides quick access to many commonly
      used dashboard features.</li>

  </ul></li>

<li>In the Team Dashboard, you can now expand the weekly earned value
report to show data for each individual team member.  This resulting
report can be very useful in weekly team meetings.</li>

<li>The play/pause button now displays new icons that make it easier
to determine whether the timer is running or stopped.</li>

<li>Tasks labels (assigned in the WBS Editor) are now displayed for each
task when you open an earned value plan in the Task &amp; Schedule window
or view a report in your browser.</li>

<li>Warning icons now appear when a task is planned to be completed
before its dependencies.</li>

<li>Since version 1.7.1b-9, team members have been able to open the
Work Breakdown Structure directly from their personal dashboard.  A
preference on the Team Project Parameters and Settings page controls
whether individuals should be allowed to make changes to the WBS.
Previously, this setting defaulted to "read-only," but with this
release, the default is to <b>allow</b> edits.  Teams that wish to
keep the WBS read-only will need to adjust the value of this setting
after upgrading.</li>

<li>A new project-specific parameter allows teams to disable
(permanently or temporarily) the alerts telling individuals that they
need to sync to the work breakdown structure.</li>

<li>Several common operations have been optimized, and now require much
less time.  For example, the dashboard may start in half the time, and
export data in one-fifth the time.</li>

</ul>


<h2>Features new in version 1.8</h2>

<ul>

 <li>Several enhancements to the team functionality:<ul>

   <li>Individuals can now open the team Work Breakdown Structure directly
   from their personal dashboard, via a new option on the script menu.</li>

   <li>If an individual needs to perform a "Synchronize to WBS" operation,
   they will receive an alert shortly after starting the dashboard.</li>

   <li> It is now possible to view the rolled up time log for team and master
   projects.</li>

   <li>The Team Project Parameters and Settings page now allows each team to
   select the set of phases they wish to appear in team forms, charts, and
   reports.</li>

   <li> It is now possible to define a defect type standard at the team level
   for shared use by the members of a team project.</li>
 
 </ul></li>

 <li>Several enhancements to earned value support:<ul>

   <li>Forecast dates are calculated for every task in the EV schedule.</li>

   <li>A new "Replan" column has been added to the earned value task list,
   displaying the planned dates that would result if you were to "replan from
   today."</li>

   <li> In addition to the "Chart" button, the Task & Schedule window now
   contains a "Filtered Chart" button. This button will display a filtered
   view of the earned value charts and statistics, for the selected portion of
   the hierarchical task list.</li>

   <li>On the "Combined" earned value chart, the "Actual Time" line has been
   replaced with an "Actual Cost" line. With this change, the three lines on
   that chart are now displaying traditional BCWS, BCWP, and ACWP
   metrics.</li>

   <li>Drag-and-drop can be used to reorder tasks in the Flat View of an
   earned value schedule.</li>

 </ul></li>

 <li>A new option has been added to the "C > Tools" menu, allowing the user to
   save a backup of their data directory to a file.</li>

 <li>A new Quick Launcher tool is provided for quickly opening a dashboard
   instance without making a shortcut first.</li>

 <li>A new visual indicator has been added to the main Process Dashboard
   toolbar, displaying the percent spent for the current task.</li>

 <li>When a user manually enters interrupt time in their time log, the delta
   time is now adjusted accordingly.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Features new in version 1.7</h2>

<ul>

 <li>The Process Dashboard now contains extensive, powerful 
   functionality to support project teams, including:<ul>

   <li>Support for team projects (to roll-up metrics and schedule data
     from several individuals) and master projects (to roll-up metrics
     and schedule data from several teams)</li>

   <li>Streamlined project planning tools enable rapid creation of
     balanced, top-down team project plans</li>

   <li>Powerful reporting tools allow the creation of custom forms,
     charts, and reports that analyze project metrics and earned value
     at the team level</li>

   <li>Tracking of task dependencies assists with coordination of work
     within and across project teams</li>

   </ul></li>

 <li>The Process Dashboard now contains extensive support for
   internationalization.  A Localization Tool is provided to help
   users translate dashboard messages into their native language, and
   share those translations with other users.</li>

 <li>Memory usage and startup time have been reduced dramatically for
   individuals with many historical projects.</li>

 <li>The dashboard contains several enhancements to earned value
   functionality:<ul>

   <li>A new task navigation option makes it easier to work through
     the tasks in an earned value plan.</li>

   <li>The plan and forecast lines on the earned value charts can be
     toggled off.</li>

   <li>The earned value report can display your task list
     hierarchically, and display rolled-up calculations such as
     "percent complete" at various levels.</li>

   <li>Export a GANTT chart of an earned value plan to MS Project</li>

   <li>Export an HTML snapshot of an earned value plan, for status
       reporting and collaboration</li>

   </ul></li>

 <li>The Data Analysis center has been enhanced to support custom
   processes.  Users who define a custom process will see customized
   versions of Report 3, 4, and 5 for their process.</li>

 <li>The Process Dashboard now integrates with a wide variety of web
   browsers on all platforms.  In particular, Unix/Linux users no
   longer need to use an older version of Netscape to view dashboard
   forms.</li>

 <li>The dashboard can be opened in read-only mode, making it possible
   for a mentor/coach to look at dashboard data without worrying about
   accidentally changing data.</li>

 <li>It is now very safe to use a networked directory for storage of
   dashboard data;  the logic that saves changes will detect and
   recover from sporadic network outages.</li>

 <li>Time values are displayed on dashboard forms in hours and
   minutes.</li>

</ul>


<h2>Features new in version 1.6 (released September 1, 2003)</h2>

<ul>

 <li>The dashboard contains several innovative enhancements to earned
   value functionality:<ul>

   <li>The earned value tool in the dashboard can now calculate
     estimated prediction intervals for forecast completion date and
     forecast cost.  These intervals compare your planned progress to
     your actual progress using numerical methods and approximate
     pivotal statistics, computing a range of dates within which your
     project is likely to finish.  The dashboard can calculate these
     ranges both for individual earned value schedules and for
     rolled-up team schedules.</li>

   <li>Traditional PSP earned value planning addresses only
     &quot;direct time,&quot; omitting time spent on recurring
     activities (such as weekly meetings) and ongoing activities (such
     as communicating with customers and management, or participating
     on committees).  Unfortunately, &quot;direct time&quot; is an
     unfamiliar metric for many organizations, which are accustomed to
     tracking &quot;project time&quot; instead. As a result, senior
     managers in some organizations take issue with earned value plans
     that reflect only 15-20 direct hours per week.<br>

     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help development teams
     avoid this potential misunderstanding, the dashboard now provides
     an innovative new feature: &quot;level of effort&quot; tasks can
     be added to earned value task lists.  Although these tasks don't
     affect the earned value calculations, they do allow you to create
     a schedule that accounts for all of your &quot;project time&quot;
     - and this can help when you present plans to management for
     approval.  To add &quot;level of effort&quot; tasks to an earned
     value plan, just enter percentages for these tasks in the
     &quot;planned time&quot; column instead of durations.  (Planned
     direct time for the periods in the schedule is then calculated
     automatically by reducing the planned total time by the
     appropriate percentage.)  To help you enhance the accuracy of
     future estimates, &quot;actual time&quot; for &quot;level of
     effort&quot; tasks is also displayed as a percentage.</li>

   <li>Earned value task lists in the dashboard have always been
     hierarchically organized.  When the list of tasks for a
     particular project differs from the structure of your dashboard
     hierarchy, new features in the earned value tool allow you to
     &quot;prune&quot; and reorder tasks to better describe the work
     that needs to be done.</li>

   <li>At times in the middle of a project, you may decide that you
     wish to &quot;re-plan&quot; the remaining tasks and start with a
     fresh earned value schedule.  The dashboard now makes this
     simple: just change the starting date on your earned value
     schedule to the current date.  All work performed before the
     starting date of the schedule will be factored out of earned
     value calculations automatically.</li>

 </ul></li>

 <li>The &quot;Data Analysis&quot; center now allows you to generate
   custom charts and reports, simply by selecting options from
   drop-down lists.  The data in these custom charts and reports can
   also be exported to Excel for further custom analysis.</li>

 <li>The time log now includes a column for the entry of optional
   comments.</li>

 <li>It is now possible to create and edit custom defect type
   standards.</li>

</ul>


<h2>Features new in version 1.5 (released October 3, 2002)</h2>
<ul>
 <li>The dashboard is now compatible with version 1.4 and higher of
   the Java Runtime Environment.</li>

 <li>The dashboard now contains support for Netscape 6 and higher on
   Windows platforms, and is also compatible with the Sun Java Plug-in
   in Internet Explorer.</li>

 <li>The task and schedule planning tool now contains built-in support
   for collaboration! You can share your schedules with your
   co-workers, your manager, and/or your customer, and keep them
   up-to-date on your progress.  If you are working on a project with
   other people, you can roll up your individual schedules to create
   an earned value schedule for the project.</li>

 <li>The task and schedule planning tool helps you to avoid several
   common planning mistakes.</li>

 <li>The hierarchy editor now includes a toolbar to facilitate the
  editing of your work breakdown structure.</li>

 <li>Numerous user interface enhancements make the hierarchy editor,
   the time log editor, and the defect log editor easier to use.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Features new in version 1.4 (released February 22, 2002)</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Creating custom processes has never been easier - now you can create  
   your own process definitions for use with the dashboard by writing a simple 
   XML file.</li>

 <li>Task and schedule features help you to track your work using earned 
   value, and calculate forecasts for cost and schedule.</li>

 <li>New "data rollup" templates allow you to roll-up data from
   multiple projects. This feature makes it possible to:
  <ul>
   <li>Roll up psp data to the project level.</li>
   <li>Create multiple subsets of "To Date" data (for example, representing 
      different programming languages). The "To Date" data mechanism now 
      allows you to select, for each project, which subset should be used for 
      automatic calculations.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li>External documents are now integrated into the process scripts - click 
   on hyperlinks for documents like the PIP form, the Issue Tracking Log, 
   etc. and the appropriate document will be opened for the project you're 
   working on.</li>

 <li>A new "PROBE Wizard" simplifies the PROBE process, and provides advice 
   on which PROBE method is most appropriate.</li>

 <li>You can now export forms (like the Project Plan Summary or the Size 
   Estimating Template) to Excel for additional, custom analysis. If you want 
   to show your data to others, or save copies of forms for project 
   documentation, you can also export these forms to static HTML 
   documents.</li>

 <li>You can now "unlock" the read-only data on forms if you want to override 
   any of the calculations that the dashboard automatically performs for 
   you.</li>

 <li>The hierarchy editor now allows you to move nodes/projects. Cut and paste 
   operations make it possible to reorganize your work breakdown structure.</li>

 <li>The drop-down list on the script button now displays choices like 
   "Project Plan Summary" instead of listing the names of process phases. In 
   addition, a "script browser" makes it easy to open a script/form for any 
   project in your hierarchy without needing to navigate to that project 
   first.</li>

 <li>Checkmarks in the hierarchy menus make it easy to see which phases / 
   projects have been marked complete.</li>

 <li>The "pspdiff" program (which calculates added / deleted / modified 
   physical LOC counts) is now incorporated into the dashboard.</li>

 <li>A major overhaul of the internal data calculation engine allows the 
   dashboard to recalculate data up to 10 times faster.</li>

 <li>If you insert "Design Review" or "Code Review" phases into a PSP0 - 
   PSP1.1 project, these phases will automatically appear on the project plan 
   summary and in the process scripts.</li>

 <li>The text "ERROR" in the dashboard forms has been changed to "#VALUE!" or 
   "#DIV/0!" to behave more like Excel.</li>

 <li>An entry to enter the Total LOC was added to the Size Estimating 
   Template screen.  This only makes sense since you have to enter nearly all 
   other actual LOC measures on this form.</li>

 <li>Help was implemented via a sub menu.  Other items on the Help sub menu 
   allow you to submit bug reports online and navigate to the user online 
   help forum.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features new in version 1.3.1 (released August 14, 2001)</h2>

<ul>
 <li>Version 1.3.1 was released to address a high-priority bug present in 
   version 1.3.  No significant new features were added to 1.3 for this 
   release.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features new in version 1.3 (released July 16, 2001)</h2>

<ul>
 <li>The dashboard now includes greatly enhanced online help! Improved help 
   has been the #1 requested feature by you, the user community. We are 
   therefore pleased to offer indexed, searchable online help with ten times 
   the content of version 1.2.</li>

 <li>The dashboard now includes a "Generic" process.  When you use the 
   generic process to perform a task, it allows you to:
  <ul>
   <li>Choose any list of phases, with custom names</li>
   <li>Decide whether or not it makes sense to track defects for the task</li>
   <li>Decide whether or not it makes sense to measure size for the task, and 
      choose a custom unit of size measurement.</li>
  </ul>

  The dashboard then provides a customized Project Plan Summary Form for your 
   custom process.</li>

 <li>The dashboard now contains a mechanism for freezing baselined data. When 
   you mark the planning phase of a project complete, all the data in the 
   "Plan" column of the Project Plan Summary form will freeze and stop 
   recalculating. Similarly, when you mark the project complete, all the data 
   in the "To Date" column will freeze and stop recalculating. This makes it 
   possible to view the report again in the future without having the numbers 
   changing in the report.</li>

 <li>The dashboard can now notify you when updates are released, either to 
   the dashboard itself or to the add-on process sets you have installed.</li>

 <li>The PROBE tool now contains a drop-down box for quickly exploring PROBE 
   methods A, B, and C.</li>

 <li>The Play/Pause button now has a drop-down menu for quickly jumping to a 
   task where you have recently logged time. If you often bounce back and 
   forth between tasks for different projects, this feature makes your life 
   easier.</li>

 <li>Numerous bug fixes make the Time Log Editor more robust.</li>

 <li>The Time Log Editor now makes it easy to quickly filter your view of the 
   time log to "Today", "This Week", or "This Month". Forward and backward 
   buttons let you scroll to look at different time periods.</li>

 <li>The play/pause button and the hierarchy menus now provide audible 
   feedback to help you keep track of whether the dashboard is timing or 
   paused.</li>

 <li>The previous version of the dashboard would only write entries to the 
   time log when you changed phases; now, the time log is updated 
   continually. The data in your time log and your project plan summary forms 
   is never more than a minute old.</li>

 <li>When you find yourself fixing several defects at once (which can happen 
   often due to "fix defects" and "related defects"), the dashboard provides 
   better assistance.  It automatically ensures that only one defect timer is 
   running at a time, and maintains a stack of "interrupted" defects.</li>

 <li>The Defect Log Editor now allows defects to be deleted. It also supports 
   quick filtering to see the defects which were injected or removed in a 
   given phase.</li>

 <li>Timer icons have been placed on the HTML forms to allow navigation among 
   the phases of development without having to reach all the way up to the 
   hierarchy menus.</li>

 <li>A method was added that will allow driving of the dashboard by another 
   program.  This will allow IDE developers to add support for the 
   dashboard from within their programming environments.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features new in version 1.2 (released April 20, 2001)</h2>

<ul>
 <li>The dashboard now includes support for ALL the standard PSP processes 
   (PSP0, PSP0.1, PSP1.0, PSP1.1, PSP2.0, PSP2.1, and PSP3.0). All of the 
   online PSP process scripts and forms have been edited to conform as 
   closely as possible to the originals in the PSP book.</li>

 <li>The dashboard now displays charts and reports! Choose the "Data Analysis" 
   option on the "C" menu, and dozens of standard charts and reports are 
   available (including ALL the tables required by reports R3, R4, and R5, 
   and ALL the charts currently drawn by the SEI's "Student Workbook" Excel 
   spreadsheet). With a single click, export data to Excel for further 
   analysis.</li>

 <li>The PROBE tool is now simpler to use. Previously, it would allow you to 
   explore the correlation between any two data items; unfortunately, this 
   made it cumbersome for everyday use. Now, by default, it only displays the 
   data items traditionally used by the PSP PROBE methodology.</li>

 <li>The PSP0 - PSP1.1 processes now support optional "Design Review" and 
   "Code Review" phases.</li>

 <li>Errors in several calculations have been corrected. Also, the "To Date" 
   data calculations have been completely revamped and are now working 
   properly.</li>

 <li>Data calculation efficiency has been improved.</li>

 <li>With the addition of the standard PSP processes, the SCR/DCR processes 
   are no longer shipped with the dashboard. If are a current dashboard user, 
   and you have been using the SCR/DCR processes, your existing SCR/DCR 
   projects WILL still work. If you wish to continue creating projects that 
   use the SCR/DCR processes in the future, please download the SCR/DCR 
   process separately.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features new in version 1.1 (released February 9, 2001)</h2>

<ul>
 <li>Version 1.1 contained enhancements that made the tool significantly 
   easier to install.</li>
</ul>
