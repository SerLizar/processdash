<H1>Using the PROBE tool</H1>

<P>The PROBE tool provides assistance in making estimates by performing the 
PROBE calculations for you.</p>

<p><img src="../../Images/ProbeToolStart.png"></p>

<P>The PROBE tool can perform correlation tests and projections based on any two
process data metrics.  The Method pull-down allows quick access to the 
different estimation methods provided by the PROBE estimation method.  
Clicking on the pull-down gives the following choices:</p>

<P><img src="../../Images/ProbeToolMethods.png"></p>

<P>Choosing any of the standard PROBE methods will set the independent and 
dependent variables to their appropriate values.  The different methods are 
documented on the PROBE instructions form.</p>

<P>If you would like to explore correlations between any two other process 
metric variables, they can be chosen from the independent and dependent 
variable pull-downs.</p>

<P>Basically the PROBE tool runs a correlation test on the two sets of data 
chosen.  It then reports the various statistical measurements on the dialog.  
There are two types of measurements shown on the dialog: those that show 
relationships between the sets of data chosen (r<sup>2</sup>, p, Variance, 
Standard Deviation), and those that are related to a projection based on the 
estimate entered (<i>B</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>B</i><sub>1</sub>, Range, UPI and 
LPI).  Also there are two columns of data on the tool.  The left column shows 
data based on a linear regression (this is for methods A and B the PROBE 
estimation method) and the right column shows data based on how well your 
data seem to predict on the average (this is for the different C methods of 
the PROBE estimation method).</p> 

<h2>Filtering your data set</h2>
<P>The filter button allows you to restrict the data set of the correlation 
and projection to certain projects.  It will pop up a tree view of the 
current projects stored and allow you to add or remove data items from the 
selected set.</p>

<p><img src="../../Images/ProbeFilter.png"></p>

<p>Seleted items are marked with a graphical "X".  By default the tool only 
shows projects in the tree (nodes).  You can expand this view to include the 
process phases as well by choosing the "Show leaf nodes" box.  This will 
allow you to include or reject data from among different phases of projects.  
The Apply button applies your filtering selection to the numbers in the PROBE 
dialog.</p> 

<h2>Measures of correlation</h2>
<P>On a typical estimation, you will want to choose from the different 
combinations of correlations available to see if any of the data correlate 
well enough to be used for projections.  The PROBE tool will make this quite 
simple.  Just pick the two data sets you would like to correlate, and the 
numbers on the tool will update to show you the results. The key numbers to 
examine are the measure of correlation (r<sup>2</sup>) and the significance 
measurement (p).</p>

<h3>The correlation measurement</h3>
<p>As detailed by Watts Humphrey, an r<sup>2</sup> value of over 0.5 
indicates that the number correlate well enough to use a linear regression 
method.  The degree of confidence as measured by the r<sup>2</sup> variable 
is shown on the dialog by its color.  When the value is too low to be used 
for predictive purposes, the r<sup>2</sup> value will show up in red.  Values 
that show better and better agreement are shown in different colors.  The 
colors used are: red (very bad), yellow/orange (bad), blue (good), and black 
(very good).</p>

<h3>The significance measurement</h3>
<p>The significance measurement is an indication of how significant the 
correlation is.  It is expressed in a percentage that represents the 
probability that this correlation could have happened by chance.  Low numbers 
mean that the data is probably showing a causality and can be used to make 
projections.  The same color scheme to show the relative "goodness" of the 
data is used here.</p>

<P>Both measures need to be taken into consideration before using a 
projection from a linear correlation.  There are some data combinations that 
can make one of the measurements look good while the other is bad.  For 
example if you have data that correlate well but the significance of that 
correlation is not very high, you could be looking at a random occurrence.</p>

<h2>Making a projection</h2>
<P>To make a projection, just enter an estimate in the Estimate entry.  The 
estimate should be an estimate of the type of data that is chosen in the top 
pull down box marked "Correlate".  For example, you should put an estimated 
number of New &amp; Changed LOC in the entry if you are correlating against 
Estimated New &amp; Changed LOC.  The % range entry will allow you to change 
the confidence interval of the projection.  Most PSP work is done at a 70% 
confidence interval, but you can set this as high or as low as you would 
like.  Setting the confidence interval higher will give you a wider range of 
possible values, and setting the interval lower will narrow the range of 
possible values.</p>

<P>The tool will update all of its data, if possible.  Some calculations may 
come out with errors do to the mathematics if the data is poorly correlated.  
The projected estimate will show up at the top of both columns (the left 
column showing the projection using linear regression and the right column 
showing the projection based on an averaging technique).  It is up to you to 
decide which numbers are appropriate for making the projection.</p>

<h2>Visualizing the data</h2>
<P>The PROBE tool also offers a scatterplot of your process data.  This view 
is chosen by clicking on the "Chart" button.</p>

<p><img src="../../Images/ProbeChart.jpg"></p>

<P>The plot will show a scatterplot of the data being used for the regression 
calculations and two lines passing through the data.  The blue line shows the 
line as projected from <i>B</i><sub>0</sub> and <i>B</i><sub>1</sub> 
calculated using linear regression, and the red line shows the line as 
projected from the averaging calculation.  Many times this visual 
representation of the data can provide insights that straight numbers may 
not.</p>

<P>The three columns below the plot display the actual values used for the 
data plotted.  The first column contains the project name, and the second and 
third columns show the data values for the X and Y axes respectively.</p>
