<h1>Optional: Create Master Project (Program Leader)</h1>

<p>In the Process Dashboard, a <b>Team Project</b> allows data to be
rolled up data from several individuals to the team level. For larger
projects, it may also be necessary to roll up data from several team
projects to the program level. <b>Master Projects</b> are designed to
meet this need.</p>

<p>To create a new master project, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>Start the Team Dashboard using the
appropriately named shortcut on the team leader's computer. The team
dashboard instance will start. (If your personal instance of the
dashboard is also running, you can easily distinguish the team
dashboard instance because it displays Team Dashboard in the title
bar, and displays a different icon for the window.)</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>On the C menu of the team dashboard,
choose the Hierarchy menu item. The Hierarchy Editor window will
appear.</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>In the Hierarchy Editor, highlight a
node in the hierarchy such as the top-level Project node. On the Edit
menu, choose Add Template&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Team Project. A new node
called Team Project will be created; give it a short name that
describes the master project. Choose File&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Save, then
File&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Close.</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>Using the dashboard Hierarchy Menus,
navigate to the project you just created. Click the dashboard Script
Button to display the Team Project Setup Wizard.</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>The Team Project Setup Wizard will
appear. Read each page carefully and supply the information
requested. One page of the wizard will ask whether you wish to create
a team project or a master project; choose the Master Project
option.</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>When the wizard finishes, you can close
the browser window.</li>

</ol>
