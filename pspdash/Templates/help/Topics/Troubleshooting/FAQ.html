<P><HR><a name="NoServer"></a><B>My web browser displays an error message when I try to view a script/form/chart/report/etc.  What is wrong?</B>

<P>The dashboard actually contains a very small HTTP server that provides all
the web content and thus the content cannot be displayed when the dashboard is
not running.  If you get an error message like "The page cannot be displayed -
cannot find server" from Internet Explorer, or "Netscape is unable to locate
the server localhost&quot; from Netscape, check to make certain that the dashboard
is running.</p>

<P>If the dashboard <b>is</b> running, and you have <b>never</b> been able to
 view a script/form/chart/report, it may be that you need to adjust your proxy
 settings.  Many people work at companies where they do not have a direct
 connection to the internet, but instead must connect to the web via an HTTP
 proxy server. If this describes you, you may need to tell your browser to
 bypass the proxy for the address &quot;localhost&quot;. The instructions below may not
 apply to your browser word-for-word, but should hopefully get you pointed in
 the right direction:
  <UL>
   <LI>For Internet Explorer, choose "Tools <IMG BORDER="0"
    SRC="../../Images/rarrow.png" WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="9"> Internet Options". Click on 
      the "Connections" tab, then on the "LAN Settings" button. Make certain 
      the "Bypass proxy server for local addresses" box is 
      <B><STRONG>checked</STRONG></B>.</li>
   <LI>For Netscape, choose "Edit <IMG BORDER="0"
    SRC="../../Images/rarrow.png" WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="9"> Preferences". Under the Category 
      "Advanced <IMG BORDER="0" SRC="../../Images/rarrow.png" WIDTH="12"
    HEIGHT="9"> Proxies", click the "Manual proxy configuration" button, 
      and ensure that the "No Proxy for" box contains &quot;localhost&quot;.</LI>
  </UL>


<P><HR><a name="NoConnection"></a><B>All my data elements say "NO CONNECTION".  What is wrong?</B>

<P>The forms always display "live" data - this allows them to auto-recalculate
numbers (like a spreadsheet does) when you edit data.  It also allows changes
made in one browser window to appear immediately in other browser windows. To
make all this happen, the browser maintains an open connection to the
dashboard, and passes data back and forth across this connection.</P>

<P>If you are viewing a form, and you close the main dashboard window, this
open connection is closed as well.  When this occurs, the form immediately
displays "NO CONNECTION" to let you know that your changes are no longer making
it back to the dashboard's data repository. To fix the problem, you must
<OL>
 <LI>restart the dashboard</li>
 <LI>click the refresh/reload button on your browser.</li>
</OL>

<P>If the dashboard <em>is running</em> and you are still getting "NO 
CONNECTION" in the data elements, it could be that the data port that the 
dashboard is trying to use is already taken on your machine.  Normally the 
dashboard will search for an open port to establish the connection, making 
this kind of problem unlikely.  However, if you have overridden this behavior 
in the configuration file the dashboard will not search for a port and may be 
experiencing a conflict with some other process on your machine.  To fix this 
problem, you must</p>
<OL>
 <LI>stop the dashboard</li>
 <LI>remove the following line from your configuration file:
  <pre>
   http.port=&lt;some port number&gt;
  </pre>
 </li>
 <li>restart the dashboard</li>
</ol>

<P>This will allow the dashboard to search for an available communications 
port.</p>

<P><HR><a name="ERROR"></a><B>Some of my data elements say
&quot;<code>#VALUE!</code>&quot; or &quot;<code>#DIV/0!</code>&quot;. What is wrong?</B>
<P> &quot;<code>#VALUE!</code>&quot; indicates that the dashboard cannot
calculate a value because the formula references a value that is missing
(displayed as &quot;<CODE>?????</CODE>&quot;) or otherwise invalid (for
example, a value like &quot;<CODE>foo</CODE>&quot; when a number was
expected).
When you see &quot;<code>#VALUE!</code>&quot; in a dashboard form, it almost <I>always</I>
means that there is a &quot;<code>?????</code>&quot; field somewhere that you still need
to fill in. If you fill in all the &quot;<code>?????</code>&quot; fields
and the &quot;<code>#VALUE!</code>&quot; field does not recalculate, check
to ensure that the calculation is not <A
HREF="../Planning/DataFreezing.html">frozen</A>.</P>

<P> &quot;<code>#DIV/0!</code>&quot; indicates that the dashboard encounted a divide-by-zero error when
calculating a particular data value. Many times this is due to having a very small number of
usable data points recorded by the dashboard.  For instance, if you start the
dashboard for the first time and try to look at Process Summary forms for a
PSP2.1 process, the "% To Date" fields will be filled with &quot;<code>#DIV/0!</code>&quot;.  This is
because the total amount of time recorded in the tool is 0.  The percentage
calculation attempts to divide by zero and returns the error.</P>

<P>Another problem can contribute to this condition as well.  If you are not 
in the habit of clicking the little "completion" checkbox at the right end of 
the dashboard, some (or all) of your data will be ignored by the dashboard 
when creating reports and graphs.  The reporting features of the dashboard 
only report tasks/projects that are marked as complete.  See the <a 
href="../Execution/CompletionButton.html">Using the Completion Checkbox</a> 
help topic for more information.</P>

<P><HR><a name="BadExcel"></a><B>I tried to export my data to Excel with the link on one of the forms, but I just got a small ASCII file.  What is wrong?</B>

<P>For the "Export to Excel" functionality to work seamlessly, you must have 
the &quot;.IQY&quot; file type properly set up on your system.  This setup is normally 
performed by Microsoft Office during the installation process for Excel.</p>

<P>If the IQY file type is not properly set up, clicking the "Export to 
Excel" links may instead cause Notepad to appear with a short, three-line 
text file. Alternatively, that three line text file might appear in an Excel 
spreadsheet.</p>

<P>If you encounter such problems, try reinstalling Excel.  If that does not 
solve the problem, you might try configuring the IQY file type manually. If
all else fails, add the following line to your <a
href="../AdvancedTopics/ConfigurationFile.html">configuration file</a>:</p>

<pre> excel.exportMethod=mime</pre>

<p>And data will be exported to Excel <A
HREF="../PostmortemAnalysis/ExportingData.html#static">statically</A>.</P>

<P><HR><a name="WhereIsConfig"></A><B>Where is the configuration file located?</B>
<P>The configuration file is named <code>.pspdash</code> on Unix systems and
<code>pspdash.ini</code> on Windows systems.  It can be located in either of
two places: the user's data directory or the user's home directory (on Unix 
systems).  The dashboard looks in the data directory first, then in the user's
home directory.  To find out exactly where your configuration file is located,
choose "About" from the configuration menu, then click on the link for "user
settings". See the <a
href="../AdvancedTopics/ConfigurationFile.html">configuration file</A> help
topic for more information about the configuration file and the settings that
can be defined there.</P>

<P><HR><a name="NoSubmit"></A><B>Why is there no "submit" button on the HTML forms?</B>
<P>The HTML forms used by the dashboard are continually "live".  There is no 
need to press a submit button to send your data to the dashboard.  Simply 
enter your data where necessary, and the dashboard will record it.  However,
after editing a data field, it is usually necessary to leave that field for
your changes to take effect.  You can press the TAB button or click somewhere
else on the page. If the data you are changing is related to other data items 
on the page, you should see the other data elements update. For more
information, see the <A HREF="../Planning/EnteringData.html">Entering process data</A>
help topic.</P>


<P><HR><a name="TimerUpdate"></a><B>I've started the timer, but none of the numbers on my reports are changing.  How can I know that it is working?</b>

<p>When the timer is running and you first navigate to an activity, the
dashboard will not create an entry in the time log until you have spent a full
minute there; this is by design.  For a more detailed explanation, see the
help topic for the <a href="../Execution/PlayPause.html#timelogdelay">play /
pause button</a>.</P>

<P>Also, the dashboard will make a quiet "tick" sound whenever the timer 
starts and when a new project or project phase is chosen by the hierarchy 
menus when the timer is running. If you do not hear this sound, check the 
state of the play/pause button.  The current state of the timer can always be 
determined by positioning the mouse pointer over the play/pause button.  A 
tooltip help will pop up containing the current state.</p> 


<P><HR><a name="FrozenData"></a><B>I made a mistake in one of my numbers on the Project Plan Summary form, but the form won't let me change the numbers! What can I do?</b>
<P>The dashboard will "freeze" your planning data once you have completed the 
planning phase by clicking the completion checkbox.  Also it will freeze all 
the data when the project is marked as complete.  You can make these numbers 
editable by marking either the project or the planning phase incomplete 
again.  For more info on freezing data see the <a 
href="../Execution/CompletionButton.html">completion checkbox</a> help 
topic.</p>

<P>&nbsp;<HR><a name="WhereData"></a><B>Where is my PSP data stored?</B>
<P>The dashboard stores all of your data in a single directory, in plain text
files.  This directory is often referred to in this documentation as the "data
directory".  With the current default configuration, data is always stored in
the "current working directory" when the dashboard is run.</P>

<P>On Windows systems, the "current working directory" is set by the icon you
use to run the dashboard.  If you right-click on that icon and choose
"Properties", there will be a text field labelled "Start in:" which identifies
your data directory.  Altering this value will change the location where the
dashboard looks for your data.  It is possible to have multiple, independent
data directories all on the same machine; just make copies of the icon you use
to start the dashboard, and give each icon a different value for the "Start in"
directory.</P>

<P>You can find out the exact location of your data directory by choosing
"About" from the configuration menu, then clicking on the link for "user
settings".</p>


<P><HR><a name="MoveData"></A><B>How can I backup my psp data and/or move it to another computer?</B>

<P>If you want to backup your psp data, simply back up the contents of your
<a href="#WhereData">data directory</a>.  To move your psp data to a different
computer,<UL>
<LI>stop the dashboard if it is running</LI>
<LI>copy the contents of your data directory to a directory on the new
    computer</LI>
<LI>run the dashboard on the new computer, using the chosen directory as the
    data directory.</LI></UL>


<P><HR><a name="FormsColors"></a><b>What is the significance of the different text colors on the PSP process scripts and forms?</b>
<P>In his book <I>A Discipline for Software Engineering</I> where he outlines 
the Personal Software Process, Watts Humphrey introduces the various process 
elements for doing PSP work in a graduated manner.  Each PSP process is built 
upon the previous one.  As a way of showing which process elements were added 
to the previous process definition, the forms in the book highlight the new 
process elements in <b><i>bold italics</i></b>.  These highlighted elements
return to normal text at the next process level. In our attempt to make our
online forms as identical to the PSP forms as possible, we have included that
detail.</P>

<P>However, the Process Dashboard makes certain steps on the scripts and forms
unnecessary (e.g. instructions to sum up various data items -- the dashboard
sums them for you).  These unnecessary process steps are displayed as
greyed-out text.</P>

<P>Also, there are places where the dashboard <i>slightly</i> changes the way
certain steps are performed (e.g.  instead of performing a PROBE calculation,
the PROBE tool should be used).  Green text is used to indicate this slight
departure from the <i>true</i> PSP scripts and forms.</P>

<P><HR><a name="ExtDocFail"></a><b>I click on a document hyperlink in a
process script, but the document never opens.</b><P>For maximum
portability, the document templates provided with the dashboard are rich
text files (.rtf). Some browsers (most notably Netscape on the Linux
platform) don't know what to do with a rich text file, and so they prompt
you to save it (not very helpful). To solve this problem, you must:</P>


<OL>
  <LI>Obtain a program capable of editing rich text files, and install it
    on your machine.&nbsp; (&quot;Star Office&quot; is one possibility; it
    is free and runs on Linux.)</LI>
  <LI>Configure your web browser, and tell it that files ending with
    &quot;.rtf&quot; and/or files of mime type
    &quot;application/rtf&quot; should be opened with the program you just
    installed.</LI>
</OL>


<P><HR><a name="DCRSCR"></a><b>What happened to the DCR and SCR processes?</b>
<P>The DCR and SCR processes which were shipped with prior versions of the 
Process Dashboard are still available, but are now distributed as add-on 
process sets.  They can be downloaded from the Process Dashboard website at 
<em>http://processdash.sourceforge.net.</em>  For instructions on 
installation of add-on process sets, see the <a 
href="../Overview/HowToInstall.html">installation</a> help topic.</p>

<P><HR><a name="Auto"></a><B>I would like to integrate the dashboard more closely with my IDE. Is it possible to programatically start/stop the timer, and change the active hierarchy path?</B>

<P>Yes! If you issue an HTTP request of the form:

<PRE><FONT SIZE="-2">http://localhost:2468/control/startTiming.class</FONT></PRE>

the dashboard timer will start.  Similarly, an HTTP request of the form:

<PRE><FONT SIZE="-2">http://localhost:2468/control/stopTiming.class</FONT></PRE>

will pause the timer. And

<PRE><FONT SIZE="-2">http://localhost:2468/Non+Project/foo//control/setPath.class</FONT></PRE>

will change the current hierarchy path to "/Non Project/foo&quot;. If you want
to change the current hierarchy path <b>and</b> start the timer, use

<PRE><FONT SIZE="-2">...//control/setPath.class<B>?start</B></FONT></PRE>

<B>Note</B>: these commands will have no effect unless the HTTP
request originates from the same machine where the dashboard is
running.

<P><HR><a name="Website"></a><b>Where can I get the latest information about the Process Dashboard?</b>
<P>The latest developments in the development of the Process Dashboard, 
including the latest version, can be found at
