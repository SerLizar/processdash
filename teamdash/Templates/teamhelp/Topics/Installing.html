<h1>Install Process Dashboard</h1>

<p>Run the installation program by following the steps
described below:</p>

<h2>Installing on Windows</h2>

<ol>

<li>If you have a CD-ROM containing the software, insert it into your
computer. The installation process should start automatically. If it
does not start automatically, double-click the file <tt>setup.exe</tt>
on the CD-ROM. If you have a ZIP file containing the software, unzip
it and double-click the extracted file <tt>setup.exe</tt>.<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>The Process Dashboard requires a recent version of the Java
Runtime Environment (JRE) to operate. If the JRE is not already
installed on your computer, it will be installed. Choosing the default
values at all prompts is recommended.<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li><a name="installSteps"></a>The Process Dashboard installer will
open:

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/installer-startup.png"></p></li>

<li>You may accept the default values for each prompt. When you reach
the page asking which packs you wish to install, team leaders and
process mentors should select the &quot;Tools for Team Leaders&quot;
option. Individual team members <b><u>do not</u></b> need to select
this option.

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/installer-packs-desel.png"></p></li>

<li>The installer will allow you to select a directory where personal
metrics data will be stored. You may accept the default value.
<b>Note:</b> if you are upgrading the dashboard from an earlier version,
and you previously chose to place your personal data in some other
location, it is important to enter the true location of your personal data
in this field.  If you neglect to do this, you can run the installer a
second time to set the data location correctly.<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>Team leaders and process mentors will be prompted to identify a
directory where team configuration information will be
stored. Choosing a directory on a shared network server is generally
required. The team leader or program manager should identify a shared
network directory that all individuals can access. Then, the program
manager and all team leads should select that <b><u>same
directory</u></b> at this prompt.<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>At the end of the installation, you will be given the opportunity
to create shortcuts for starting the Process Dashboard. Click the
Create Shortcuts button.

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/installer-shortcuts.png"></p>

<a name="twoInstances"></a>This will create application shortcuts for
your use:

    <ul style="margin-top: .5em; margin-bottom: .5em">

    <li>A <b>Process Dashboard</b> shortcut will always be created,
    which allows you to manage your own personal data. (Even team
    leaders and process mentors will typically have some project tasks
    assigned to them; they should use this <i>personal instance</i> of
    the dashboard to perform that work.)</li>

    <li>Team leaders and process mentors will also receive a <b>Team
    Dashboard</b> shortcut, which allows you to manage rolled-up team
    data.  Clicking this shortcut will launch a <i>team instance</i>
    of the dashboard.</li>

    </ul>

These two shortcuts launch dashboard <i>instances</i> which are
independent of each other. It is important to be cognizant of the
difference between these two instances.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Installing on Mac OS X</h2>

<p>Installing the Process Dashboard on Mac OS X requires a slightly
different process.</p>

<ol>

<li>If you received a ZIP file of the Process Dashboard software, unzip
it. Find the file called <tt>pdash-install-team-#_#_#.jar</tt> (it will be
in a <i>data</i> subdirectory; the file will contain an actual version
number rather than <tt>#_#_#</tt>).  Alternately, you may have downloaded
this JAR file directly; if that is the case, you can skip this unzip
step.<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>Double-click the <tt>pdash-install-team-#_#_#.jar</tt> file to begin
the installation process.<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>Follow the installer directions as described in the <a
href="#installSteps">section above</a>.<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>An icon will be created in the <tt>Applications</tt> folder for the
Process Dashboard.  (If you chose to install the Tools for Team Leaders
option, a Team Dashboard shortcut will be created as well.)

</ol>


<h2>Installing on Unix/Linux</h2>

<p>Installing the Process Dashboard on Unix requires a few
additional steps.</p>

<ol>

<li>Download the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) from Sun Microsystems
by visiting their Website <u>http://java.sun.com/</u>;.  Install the
software. Edit your executable path to include the <tt>java</tt>
program.<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>Install Firefox on your system if it is not already
installed. Edit your executable path to include the <tt>firefox</tt>
program.<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>Either insert the CD-ROM into your computer, or unzip the ZIP file
containing the software. Find the file called
<tt>pdash-install-team-#_#_#.jar</tt> (it will be in a <i>data</i>
subdirectory; the file will contain an actual version number rather
than <tt>#_#_#</tt>). At a shell prompt, change to the directory
containing that file, and type:

<pre style='margin-left:.5in'>java -jar pdash-install-team-*.jar</pre></li>

<li>The Process Dashboard installer will appear.<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>Follow the installer directions as described in the <a
href="#installSteps">section above</a>.<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>Due to the variety of window managers on Unix platforms, the
Process Dashboard installer cannot automatically create
icons/shortcuts that you can use to run the program.
Although icons/shortcuts are not created, the installer <b>will</b>
create draft shell scripts that you may use to launch the Process
Dashboard. In the directory you designated as your <i>data
directory</i> (defaults to <tt>~/.pspdata</tt>), you will find the
file <tt>run-dash.sh</tt>. In the directory you designated as your
<i>team configuration directory</i>, you will also find a file called
<tt>run-dash.sh</tt>.  (These launch two different <i>dashboard
instances;</i> see the <a href="#twoInstances">section above</a> for
an explanation of the two instances.)  Review the contents of these
scripts; in particular, you may wish to uncomment and edit the line
that adds <tt>java</tt> and <tt>firefox</tt> to the executable
path. For convenience, you may wish to manually create icons/shortcuts
for launching the dashboard.</li>

</ol>
