<P>The Process Dashboard automates many reports and charts that can be quite 
useful in a project postmortem.</p>

<h2><a name="pps"></a>The Project Plan Summary</h2>
<P>The main report that contains the most useful postmortem information for 
your project will probably be the Project Plan Summary form.  The Project 
Plan Summary can generally be produced by navigating to the project for which 
you would like the report, clicking the script button, and selecting the
option for the Project Summary form.</p>

<h2><a name="markComplete"></a>Marking your project complete</h2>
<P>It is important to mark your project as complete.  This lets the dashboard
know that you are finished with the project, and it can use the project data to
calculate the various items in the reports and charts.  You can edit the
project completion date via the appropriate field on the Project Plan Summary.
If you haven't edited the project completion date field on the Project Plan
Summary, marking all the phases in the project complete will mark the project
complete as well.</p>

<h2><a name="logs"></a>The Time Log and Defect Log</h2>
<P>HTML versions of the Time Log and the Defect Log are also available from 
the scripts button.  If you navigate to the main Process script for any of 
the PSP processes (usually by following a link marked "top" near the bottom 
of the various reports and forms), you will links named "Time Log" and 
"Defect Log" in the text of the script.  These will bring up a read-only 
version of the two logs.</p>

<h2><a name="charts"></a>Graphical charts</h2>

<P>The dashboard also makes many graphical charts of various kinds available.
If you have any PSP components in your personal work hierarchy, the
<img src="../../Images/cmenu.png"> menu
will display a "PSP Data Analysis" option.  Choosing this option will display
a split view with an index of various chart types on the left and thumbnails
of the charts available on the right.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/DataAnalysisScreen.png"></p>

<p>Clicking any of the thumbnail charts will 
bring up a full-sized version of the chart.  When viewing a full-sized chart,
resizing your browser window will cause the chart to resize as well.  Finally,
clicking on a full-sized chart will display a table of the data used to draw
that chart.</p>

<p>The dashboard provides charts that allow</p>

<UL>
 <LI>Defect analysis - rates of injection and removal of defects in the 
   different process phases, defect injection and removal percentages in the 
   different process phases, and pie charts showing the distribution of defect 
   types.</LI>
 <LI>Plan analysis - comparisons of planned time and size with actual planned 
   time and size, planning error of both time and size, and breakdowns of the 
   amount of time spent in the different development phases.</LI> 
 <LI>Process analysis - comparisons of productivity rates, defect removal 
   yields, and appraisal to failure cost ratios.</li>
 <LI>Quality analysis - various looks at the quality metrics of defect 
   removal yield, failure and appraisal cost of quality, and LOC reviewed per 
   hour rates.</LI>
 <LI>Defect Densities and Fix Times - tables of data showing where defects
   were injected and removed in various programs, and the relative costs of
   removing them.</LI>
 <LI>Defect Phases/Types - analyses of the various types of defects, and where
   they are most often removed.</LI>
 <LI>Pareto - shows defects organized by type sorted by number and by fix 
   time.</LI>
 <LI>Custom - allows you to produce customized charts and reports based upon
   your historical data.</LI>
</UL>

<h2><a name="custom"></a>Custom charts and reports</h2>

<p>If you need a special chart or report that the Process Dashboard does not
provide, you can create your own reports using Java servlets or JSPs.  For
more information, see the <a href="../AdvancedTopics/CustomJSPs.html">Custom
JSP Reporting</a> help topic.</p>
