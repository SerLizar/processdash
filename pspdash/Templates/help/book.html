<H1><a name="para_1_"></a>1. Quick Overview</H1>
<P>We feel that the PSP<sup><small>SM</small></sup> and the 
TSP<sup><small>SM</small></sup> are remarkable technologies that can
change the face of the software industry, and we share the SEI's zeal to 
promote their widespread use. We feel that a freely available, powerful 
support tool could help to remove one of the most significant barriers to PSP 
/ TSP adoption. We therefore aim to develop a world-class tool under the 
open-source model, and distribute it freely to anyone using the PSP and/or 
TSP.  We feel that this is the least we can do to thank the SEI for 
developing and distributing these remarkable processes. </P>

<p>This tool incorporates templates, scripts, and other materials from
the book by Watts S. Humphrey, <i>A&nbsp;Discipline for Software
Engineering</i>.  Copyright &copy;&nbsp;1995 by Addison-Wesley.  These
materials are reproduced with the permission of the publisher.</p>

<p>Personal Software Process, PSP, Team Software Process, and TSP are
registered service marks of Carnegie Mellon University.</p>

<h2><a name="para_1_1_"></a>1.1. A quick look at the tool</h2>

<p><center><img src="Images/DashboardOverview.png"></center></p>

<P>The Process Dashboard attempts to keep itself as small as possible to save 
valuable screen real estate for the actual work of software development.  In 
a very small space the dashboard gives access to a stopwatch-like timer for 
timing activities, a defect entry dialog for capturing defect information,

<h2><a name="para_1_2_"></a>1.2. The dashboard and the web browser</h2>

<P>The Process Dashboard uses a web browser for the bulk of its data entry

topic for more info about which web browsers are supported and how to install 
them if necessary.</P>

<P>The<a name="doc1_webServer"></a> connection between the dashboard and the

dashboard.  It is this web server, combined with some Java scripting, that 
provides all the live data communication between the dashboard and the 
browser.  One consequence of this is that the various reports and charts that 
are displayed within the browser will not be available unless the dashboard 
is running.</P>

<H2><a name="para_1_3_"></a>1.3. The process scripts</h2>
<P>The Process Dashboard provides nearly all the scripts defined in <I>A 
Discipline for Software Engineering</i> by Watts Humphrey.  In all cases, the 
forms and scripts were designed to be as close to the "real thing" as 
possible (the "real thing" being the forms and tables in Appendix C of Watts 
Humphrey's book).  Where the online forms and scripts deviate, the text is 
color coded as follows:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Where the dashboard makes a certain step unnecessary the text is colored 
   in grey (e.g. writing entries in a time log).</li>
 <li>Where the dashboard changes the way a certain step is performed, the 
   text is colored in green (e.g. using the PROBE tool or the PROBE wizard 
   instead of performing statistical calculations via a calculator or 
   spreadsheet).</li>
</ul>

<P>Many of the process forms contain links to other forms that are used at 
that process level, making navigation through the forms simple and 
intuitive.  Also, many of the process scripts contain little stopwatch icons 
on them.  These icons provide another way to navigate and time a process 
phase.  When you click on one of these icons, the current phase being 
measured will change to the phase indicated by the icon and the timer will 
start measuring time for that phase.</p>

<P>For information on how to access the forms, see the <a href="#doc26_top">Accessing process scripts</a> help 
topic.</p>

<p>The following lists detail the forms and scripts provided by the dashboard 
at each PSP level.  Items marked by <sup>*</sup> are "live" forms that either 
update themselves with process data (e.g. the project summary forms) or can 
be expanded as necessary to permit multiple data entry (e.g. the size 
estimating template or the PSP3 cycle summary form).</p>

<P>Starting at PSP level 2, the Project Plan Summary form gets large enough 
that it is presented in a frames view so that different pieces of it can be 
seen.  The full view is also available.  These items are marked by

<h3><a name="para_1_3_1_"></a>1.3.1. <A name="doc2_generic"></A>The "generic" process script</h3>
<P>Very much of the methodology that is employed by the PSP can be used in 
other endeavors.  Any kind of work that has measurable time, size, and/or
defects can probably benefit from a PSP-like process.  The generic process 
scripts attempt to give rudimentary measurement and defect tracking for other 
work efforts.</p>

<P>When you create a project based on the generic process in the <a href="#doc18_top">hierarchy editor</a>, it will
initially contain only a planning phase and a postmortem phase.  You can
then add additional phases (and give them any names that you want) by
selecting the node corresponding to the generic project, then selecting
"Generic Phase" from the "Add Template" menu:</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/ShowAddGenericPhase.png"></center></p>

<P>The generic process then creates a tailored project plan summary form.  It
allows entry of time and size estimates, and even lets you enter the unit of
size measurement.  For example, you could run the generic process to measure
and track your progress as you write a technical paper.  The size unit would
end up being something related to the work of writing (perhaps pages).  The
generic process would capture your productivity rates and allow you to enter
defects.  Estimation support would also be available through the PROBE
tool.</p>

<h3><a name="para_1_3_2_"></a>1.3.2. <A name="doc2_timer"></A>The "timer" process script</h3>
<P>The timer process allows for estimating and measuring activities that have 
only a time aspect to them.  If you regularly perform some kind of task that 
pretty much remains the same each time, you could record estimates and times 
for that task to attempt to provide some engineering discipline.</p>

<h3><a name="para_1_3_3_"></a>1.3.3. <A name="doc2_custom"></A>Custom process scripts</h3>

<P>The dashboard has been designed from the ground up to support custom
processes.  The PSP scripts and forms that you see are not hard-coded into the
tool; instead, they are dynamically loaded from simple HTML and text files.
Thus, it is possible to create your own custom process scripts, forms, and
data that will be dynamically integrated into the dashboard.

<P>More information on creating custom processes is available in the <a href="#doc42_top"> Advanced
Topics</a> section of the help.

<h3><a name="para_1_3_4_"></a>1.3.4. Custom process vs Generic process?</h3>

<P>When should you use the generic process, and when should you create a
custom process?  In general, you should use the generic process:</P>

<UL>
<LI>If the process for this task is unlikely to be reused in the future (for
example, because the task at hand is a departure from the work you normally
do).</LI>

<LI>If the process for this task is still immature and uncertain.  As you
begin creating your own custom process definitions, the flexibility of the
generic process will allow you to radically change your process from one task
to the next in response to process improvement proposals.  Once you decide
upon and finalize the <u>list of phases</u> in your process, you are ready to
begin using a custom process script.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The generic script gives you a lot of flexibility - the phase names and
other process specifics can change from task to task, or even in the middle of
a generic project!  This flexibility comes at a price, however: without an
unchanging process definition, it isn't possible to compare "apples to apples"
across numerous generic processes.  Therefore, the generic process cannot
calculate "to date" data like a custom process can.  On the other hand, a
change to your process definition can potentially invalidate all the
historical data you've collected, so it is best to wait and define a custom
process when you feel you've confidently identified its phases.</P>

<h3><a name="para_1_4_1_"></a>1.4.1. Step 1: Create a project in the dashboard</h3>
<P>The first thing we need to do to get started is to create a new PSP1.1 
project in the dashboard.  To do that, we will start the hierarchy editor by 
choosing Hierarchy from the <a href="#doc32_top">Configure
menu</a>.</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/QSHierarchyEditorBefore.png"></center></p>

<P>We need to decide where to place this project in our work breakdown 
structure.  At this point, we can see the various other projects that have 
been worked on previously (a PSP course).</p>

<P>We will place our PSP1.1 project under the "Project" node like the others.
To do that we will select the "Project" node by clicking it once. Next we will 
pick the "Edit" menu and choose "Add Template" followed by "PSP1.1". This will
add a PSP1.1-based project to the project hierarchy as a child of "Project". 
When the new project is added, it is given a default name.  We can change the 
name to better describe what we are working on.  In this case, we will follow 
the pattern shown and name the project "5A".  For more information on using 
the hierarchy editor, see the <a href="#doc18_top">Using the hierarchy editor</a>
help topic.</P>

<P>Once the project has been created and renamed, click on the little 
expansion control to the left of the 5A project to expand its child nodes in 
the hierarchy tree.  There you can see that the dashboard has placed all the 
process phases for a PSP1.1 project.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/QSHierarchyEditorAfter.png"></center></p>

<P>Now we can save our changes and close the hierarchy editor via the File 
menu.<p>

<div></div><a name="doc5_top"></a>

<h3><a name="para_1_4_2_"></a>1.4.2. Step 2: Planning the project</h3>

<P>Now that the project exists, we can start the planning of our work.  The 
PSP provides scripts for planning, development, postmortem work, etc., so 
let's go look at the planning script for our new PSP1.1 project.  This is done 
by selecting our newly created project via the hierarchy menus (the dashboard 
will automatically select the planning phase -- the first development phase 
of a PSP1.1 project), then clicking the scripts button.  We should also click 
the play button on the dashboard to start timing our planning activities.  
When the play button is pressed, a quiet "clicking" sound will be heard.  
This sound will be heard anytime the dashboard switches phases of activity 
while the clock is running.</p>

<P><center><img src="Images/QSChoosingPlanning.png"></center></p>

<P>The dashboard responds by bringing up the PSP1.1 planning script in a web 
browser.  Reading through the script, we see that once we understand the 
requirements for program 5A, we need to do a size estimate.  To guide our 
estimation, we can use the PROBE method.  Following the <U>PROBE method</u>
link on the planning script brings up the PROBE Estimating Script.</p>

<p>Reading through this script we see that once we have produced a conceptual 
design, we need to fill out the Size Estimating Template.  The dashboard 
provides both the template itself and the instruction script for its use.  
Following the link for the <U>Size Estimating Template</u> brings up a 
dynamic HTML version of the template.  For ready reference, the template has 
a link near the top to display the Size Estimating Template instructions 
form.  If you click on this link, a second browser will be started so that 
you can have the instructions and the template side by side on your screen.  
For more information on the Size Estimating Template, see the <a href="#doc19_top">Size Estimating 
Template</a> help topic.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/QSShowSizeEstimatingTemplateTop.png"></center></p>

<P>The Size Estimating Template Instructions direct us to count the base LOC 
and enter it at entry B if this is an enhancement of a previous program.  
Program 5A is a new program, so the whole base program LOC and base additions 
sections don't apply.  We will leave those entries with their default values 
of 0.</p>

<P>New objects will be a place for most of our estimating.  The student who 
produced the data used for this example estimated that 5 new objects would be 
created.  Their types, number of methods, and LOC estimates are entered under 
the new objects section of the form.  The "add more rows for new objects"
link will expand the form with more entries if chosen.</p>

<P>The student who worked this problem did not have any entries for the 
reused objects section of the form, so we will skip that section as well.</P>

<P>Moving on to the size calculation, we need to calculate the estimated new 
&amp; changed LOC using PROBE. There are at least two ways to do this: with
the PROBE Wizard or with the PROBE tool. (The PROBE Wizard automates
the standard PSP PROBE process, and is simpler to use; the PROBE tool is
more complex to use but provides more power for custom statistical
analyses). For this example, we will use the PROBE Wizard. After you
complete the top portion of the Size Estimating Template, you can launch
the PROBE wizard by clicking on the hyperlink halfway down the page.</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/ProbeWizardLink.png"></center></p>

<P>The PROBE Wizard consists of a series of dialogs that guide you through 
the PROBE process.</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/QSProbeWizardStartup.png"></center></p>

<P>The PROBE script gives several ways to calculate an estimate. The PROBE
Wizard displays these methods side by side and ranks them, advising us
which method may be the most reliable. By simply following the prompts, we
decide in this example to select method C2 for size and then choose C2 for
time. As we make these choices, the resulting values are automatically
written into the appropriate fields of the Size Estimating Template. After 
our planning efforts on this form it looks like the following:</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/QSSizeEstimatingTemplateDone.png"></center></p>

<P>When we bring up the Project Plan Summary, we see that the planning data 
is all entered automatically.  Time to click the little done button on the 
dashboard and move on into design!</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/QSFinishPlanning.png"></center></p>

<P>Note also that when the dashboard moves into a new phase while the timer 
is running, a little "clicking" noise is made.  This little bit of feedback 
assures us that the timer is still running.</p>

<h3><a name="para_1_4_3_"></a>1.4.3. Step 3: Designing the program</h3>

<P>The PSP provides Development scripts for all the levels.  To access the 
development script for this program, we can click the back button on the web 
browser to take us back to the main Process script which contains a link to 
the Development script, or we can just press the scripts button again.  When 
the scripts button is pressed, the dashboard always opens the web browser on 
a form that is appropriate for the current process phase.  In this case, it 
will open to the Development script.  We can also use the pull-down control 
on the scripts button.  Pressing the pull-down will bring up a menu of the 
scripts and forms available for the project.  Picking a script or form from
the menu will open that form in a web browser.  In this case, picking
&quot;PSP1.1 Development Script&quot; will take us to the development
script.</p>

<p>While designing program 5A, we will be sure to keep the dashboard's timer 
running.  This can be confirmed by noticing the state of the play/pause 
button.  For more information on the play/pause button, see the <a href="#doc27_top">play/pause button</a> help topic.</P>

well.</p>

<P>To enter a defect, click the defect button.</P>

<P>Consider the following circumstance: you find a defect and put in a fix.  
Upon compiling your fix you discover that you have inadvertently injected 
another defect (perhaps a syntax error in your coding).  This is what the PSP 
calls a "fix defect" -- a defect injected while entering a fix for another 
defect.</p>

<P>The dashboard has a very handy feature to help in this regard.  While the 
defect dialog for one defect is open, you can click on the little defect 
button in the corner to enter a new defect for the fix of the current 
defect.</p>

<P><center><img src="Images/QSPointToFixDefectButton.png"></center></p>

<P>After clicking the Fix Defect button, a new defect dialog will open for 
entry of data for this new defect.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/QSTwoDefectDialogs.png"></center></p>

<P>While this new defect dialog is open, the timer for the previous defect 
dialog is paused.  Also, notice that the number of the previous defect is 
already entered in the Fix Defect blank.  Once the information for this new 
defect is entered and the user clicks OK, the previous defect dialog will pop 
to the front of the screen and the timer will resume.  For more information 
about this behavior, see the <a href="#doc30_top">Entering Defects</a> help topic.</p>

<P>Back to our example.  Once the program has been sufficiently tested and 
all the defects have been entered, hit the completion checkbox again to move 
into Postmortem.</p>

<h3><a name="para_1_4_7_"></a>1.4.7. Step 7: Postmortem</h3>

<P>The PSP provides Postmortem scripts for all of the PSP levels.  To get to 
the postmortem for the current program, we can click the link at the bottom 
of the development script.  Also, clicking the script button on the dashboard 
while in the postmortem phase will bring up the postmortem script, or using 
the pull-down control on the scripts button will display an option for the postmortem script as well.</p>

<P>After making sure that the entry criteria are met, the next step that must 
be done is to enter the actual size data for the program.  Actual values for 
base, deleted, modified, total, base additions, new and reused LOC can be 
entered on the Size Estimating Template form, which can be reached by 
clicking the appropriate link from the postmortem script. The data entered 
into the Size Estimating Template will automatically be reflected in the 
Project Plan Summary form, as well.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/QSEnterActualLOC.png"></center></p>

<P>Once the actual size information (including measures of reuse) has been 
entered on the Size Estimating Template form, we can mark the postmortem 
phase complete. Once all the phases in the process have been marked 
complete, the dashboard will mark the project itself complete as well.  We 
can double check that it has been marked by looking at the Project Completion 
checkbox on the Project Plan Summary.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/QSCheckProjectComplete.png"></center></p>

<p>If the Project Complete checkbox had not been automatically checked, it 
would indicate that we had already overridden this automatic behavior.  You 
can learn more about the relationship between marking the phases complete and 
marking the entire project complete by reading the <a href="#doc28_top">Using the completion checkbox</a>
help topic.</p>

<p>At the end of this project, the entire Project Plan Summary form looks 
like this.</p>

<P><center><img src="Images/QSProjectPlanSummary.png"></center></p>

<P>The Process Dashboard also offers several other aids for analyzing 
postmortem data.  Choosing Data Analysis from the "C" menu will open the web 
browser to a set of pages that contain many useful graphs of process data.</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/QSDataAnalysis.png"></center></p>

<P>This Data Analysis page provides several different categories of charts to 
allow easy analysis of various metrics measured in the PSP.  Clicking on one 
of the chart thumbnails in the right pane will bring up a full-sized view of 
that chart.  For more information on the types of data that can be analyzed 
via these reports and graphs, see the <a href="#doc35_top">Creating Reports and 
Charts</a> help topic.</p>

<P>That's it for this example.  We hope it has been helpful.</p>

<H2><a name="para_1_5_"></a>1.5. Overall goals</H2>
<P>We feel that the PSP and the TSP are remarkable technologies that can change 
the face of the software industry, and we share the SEI's zeal to promote their 
widespread use. We feel that a freely available, powerful support tool could 
help to remove one of the most significant barriers to PSP / TSP adoption. We 
therefore aim to develop a world-class tool under the open-source model, and 
distribute it freely to anyone using the PSP and/or TSP. We feel that this is 
the least we can do to thank the SEI for developing and distributing these 
remarkable processes. </P>

<a name="doc11_psp"></a><H3><a name="para_1_5_1_"></a>1.5.1. What is the PSP<SUP>(SM)</SUP>?</H3>
<P>The Personal Software Process<SUP>(SM)</SUP>, created by Watts Humphrey of 
the Software Engineering Institute, introduces software engineers to a 
disciplined process for software engineering. Engineers using the PSP to 
develop software follow defined processes and collect detailed metrics on the 
time required to produce a product, the defects that were injected and 
removed at various stages in development, and the size of the finished 
product.</P>

<P>These metrics are then analyzed using statistical methods, enabling 
engineers to produce highly accurate estimates based on historical data, 
track progress and quality of a project in progress, predict schedule 
impacts, and predict the quality of a finished software product. The PSP 
encourages engineers to quantitatively determine ways to improve their 
process.</P>

<P>For more information on the PSP, see the official PSP website at 
<U>http://www.sei.cmu.edu/tsp</u>, maintained by Carnegie Mellon 
University.</P>

<a name="doc11_tsp"></a><H3><a name="para_1_5_2_"></a>1.5.2. What is the TSP<SUP>(SM)</SUP>?</H3>
<P>The Team Software Process<SUP>(SM)</SUP>, also created by Watts Humphrey, 
is a process framework for teams of PSP-trained engineers. The TSP scales 
well and can be used by teams of 3 to 20 people to develop software products 
of significant size and complexity.</P>

<P>Teams of engineers using both the PSP and the TSP to develop software have 
consistently observed remarkable improvements in their work:</P>

<UL>
 <LI>End-to-end productivity improvements of 20% - 150%</li>
 <LI>99% reductions in system test defects, and virtually defect-free 
   released software.</li>
 <LI>Schedule estimates accurate to within 10% (4% error on average)</LI>
</UL>

<H3><a name="para_1_5_3_"></a>1.5.3. Why build a tool?</H3>
<P>Both the PSP and the TSP require the collection and analysis of metrics at 
a <I>very</I> fine-grained level. Further, TSP requires teams to roll-up 
individual metrics to produce team metrics. Once data are collected at this 
level, statistical analyses of the data permit remarkable planning, tracking, 
prediction, and control of software products and projects.</P>

<P>These metrics collection and analysis processes, however, are not trivial. 
In any real-world project, tool support for the PSP and TSP become important 
considerations. Although studies have demonstrated that people <U>can</U>
maintain their productivity when using the PSP <I>without</I> tool support, 
the "frustration factor" inherent with such an approach tries the patience of 
all but the most disciplined engineers, making PSP behaviors difficult to 
sustain.</P>

<P>Ideally, PSP/TSP practitioners would like to have a support tool that:</P>

<UL>
 <LI>Allows data at the personal level to be collected quickly and easily, 
   with minimal frustration.</li>
 <LI>Can be integrated with existing development environments and project 
   management tools.</li>
 <LI>Allows individuals to collaborate on the execution of a process (even if 
   they are geographically distributed).</li>
 <LI>Allows data at the individual level to be rolled up to produce 
   team-level or organizational-level metrics.</li>
 <LI>Protects the privacy of individuals, and prevents unauthorized people 
   from seeing or using their data.</li>
 <LI>Supports powerful analyses of data at the individual, team, 
   organizational, and enterprise levels, and allows existing (external) 
   applications to access the data (while still maintaining the security 
   mentioned above).</li>
 <LI>Supports arbitrary processes (including processes that have yet to be 
   written), and arbitrary new process tools.</LI>
</UL>

<P>This initiative aims to develop an open-source tool to meet all of these 
needs.</P>

<P>Development on the dashboard is ongoing. To see the list of features 
currently supported / being worked on, select the "Coming Soon" link on our 
web site: <u>http://processdash.sourceforge.net</u>.</P>

<H2><a name="para_1_6_"></a>1.6. Using help</H2>

<P>This help system is a standard JavaHelp implementation.  Starting the help 
system is as easy as clicking "help" on the "C" (configure) menu.</p>

<P>Currently the help system provides three ways of accessing help topics:</P>
<UL>
 <LI>A table of contents view</LI>
 <LI>An index view</LI>
 <LI>A search engine view</LI>
</UL>

<P>These three views are accessed via the three tabs at the top of the left 
screen pane.</P>

<h3><a name="para_1_6_1_"></a>1.6.1. The Table of Contents view</h3>
<P>The table of contents provides a hierarchical organization of the help 
topics.  Items that are shown as books represent logical groupings of help 
topics and can be clicked to reveal more detailed help.</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/ShowHelpTOC.png"></center></p>

<h3><a name="para_1_6_2_"></a>1.6.2. The Index view</h3>
<P>The index view provides an alphabetical listing of various keywords on 
which to find help.</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/ShowHelpIndex.png"></center></p>

<h3><a name="para_1_6_3_"></a>1.6.3. <a name="doc12_search"></a>The Search Engine view</h3>
<P>The search engine view provides an entry blank where you can enter 
words you would like the help system to search for within the help topics.  
After entering search criteria you will be presented with a list of help 
topics that contained the word or words entered.  To the left of each item 
will be a number indicating how many times the word(s) entered were found in 
that particular help topic.</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/ShowHelpSearch.png"></center></p>

<h3><a name="para_1_6_4_"></a>1.6.4. The navigation buttons</h3>
<P>The help viewer also provides two navigation buttons at the top left.  
They allow for the familiar "back" and "forward" functionalities that are so 
common in modern web browsers.</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/ShowHelpNavigationButtons.png"></center></p>

<h3><a name="para_1_6_5_"></a>1.6.5. The print buttons</h3>
<p>The two buttons to the right of the navigation buttons are a "Print Topic"
button and a "Page Setup" button.  These buttons allow you to print a help 
topic for later reading.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/ShowHelpPrintButtons.png"></center></p>

<h3><a name="para_1_6_6_"></a>1.6.6. Context sensitive help</h3>
<P>There is also some context sensitive help available.  If you press the F1 
key while viewing the dashboard itself or one of its tools (PROBE, time log 
editor, etc.), the dashboard will startup a help screen pertinent to that 
tool.</p>

<H2><a name="para_1_7_"></a>1.7. How To Install</H2>

<H3><a name="para_1_7_1_"></a>1.7.1. System Requirements</H3>
<P>The Process Dashboard is 100% Java, and will run on any system with a Java 
2 compliant virtual machine. This includes Windows, Linux, Unix,
and Macintosh systems. For access to forms and scripts, a web browser is also required.</p>

<P>To use the process dashboard, you must <b>first</b> install the following 
software:</P>

<UL>
 <LI>The Java Runtime Environment, version 1.3 or greater (available from Sun 
   Microsystems at <u>http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/jre</u>)</li>

      <B><STRONG>not</STRONG></B> currently compatible with the dashboard.</LI>
  </UL>
 <LI>Make certain that Java and JavaScript are enabled in your browser. (This 
   is typically the default setting, so you usually don't need to worry about 
   enabling these unless you explicitly disabled them in the past.)</li>
 <LI>If you connect to the internet via a proxy server, you may need to tell 
   your browser to bypass the proxy for the address "localhost". The 
   instructions below may not apply to your browser word-for-word, but should 
   hopefully get you pointed in the right direction:
  <UL>
   <LI>For Internet Explorer, choose &quot;Tools <IMG BORDER="0" SRC="Images/rarrow.png" WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="9"> Internet 
      Options&quot;. Click on the "Connections" tab, then on the "LAN

 <li>External documents are now integrated into the process scripts - click 
   on hyperlinks for documents like the PIP form, the Issue Tracking Log, 
   etc. and the appropriate document will be opened for the project you're 
   working on.</li>

 <li>A new "PROBE Wizard" simplifies the PROBE process, and provides advice 
   on which PROBE method is most appropriate.</li>

 <li>You can now export forms (like the Project Plan Summary or the Size 
   Estimating Template) to Excel for additional, custom analysis. If you want 
   to show your data to others, or save copies of forms for project 
   documentation, you can also export these forms to static HTML 
   documents.</li>

 <li>You can now "unlock" the read-only data on forms if you want to override 
   any of the calculations that the dashboard automatically performs for 
   you.</li>

 <li>The hierarchy editor now allows you to move nodes/projects. Cut and paste 
   operations make it possible to reorganize your work breakdown structure.</li>

 <li>The drop-down list on the script button now displays choices like 
   "Project Plan Summary" instead of listing the names of process phases. In 
   addition, a "script browser" makes it easy to open a script/form for any 
   project in your hierarchy without needing to navigate to that project 
   first.</li>

 <li>Checkmarks in the hierarchy menus make it easy to see which phases / 
   projects have been marked complete.</li>

 <li>The "pspdiff" program (which calculates added / deleted / modified 
   physical LOC counts) is now incorporated into the dashboard.</li>

 <li>A major overhaul of the internal data calculation engine allows the 
   dashboard to recalculate data up to 10 times faster.</li>

 <li>If you insert "Design Review" or "Code Review" phases into a PSP0 - 
   PSP1.1 project, these phases will automatically appear on the project plan 
   summary and in the process scripts.</li>

 <li>The text "ERROR" in the dashboard forms has been changed to "#VALUE!" or 
   "#DIV/0!" to behave more like Excel.</li>

 <li>An entry to enter the Total LOC was added to the Size Estimating 
   Template screen.  This only makes sense since you have to enter nearly all 
   other actual LOC measures on this form.</li>

 <li>Help was implemented via a sub menu.  Other items on the Help sub menu 
   allow you to submit bug reports online and navigate to the user online 
   help forum.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="para_1_8_2_"></a>1.8.2. Features new in version 1.3.1 (released August 14, 2001)</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Version 1.3.1 was released to address a high-priority bug present in 
   version 1.3.  No significant new features were added to 1.3 for this 
   release.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="para_1_8_3_"></a>1.8.3. Features new in version 1.3 (released July 16, 2001)</h3>

<ul>
 <li>The dashboard now includes greatly enhanced online help! Improved help 
   has been the #1 requested feature by you, the user community. We are 
   therefore pleased to offer indexed, searchable online help with ten times 
   the content of version 1.2.</li>

 <li>The dashboard now includes a "Generic" process.  When you use the 
   generic process to perform a task, it allows you to:
  <ul>
   <li>Choose any list of phases, with custom names</li>
   <li>Decide whether or not it makes sense to track defects for the task</li>
   <li>Decide whether or not it makes sense to measure size for the task, and 
      choose a custom unit of size measurement.</li>
  </ul>

  The dashboard then provides a customized Project Plan Summary Form for your 
   custom process.</li>

 <li>The dashboard now contains a mechanism for freezing baselined data. When 
   you mark the planning phase of a project complete, all the data in the 
   "Plan" column of the Project Plan Summary form will freeze and stop 
   recalculating. Similarly, when you mark the project complete, all the data 
   in the "To Date" column will freeze and stop recalculating. This makes it 
   possible to view the report again in the future without having the numbers 
   changing in the report.</li>

 <li>The dashboard can now notify you when updates are released, either to 
   the dashboard itself or to the add-on process sets you have installed.</li>

 <li>The PROBE tool now contains a drop-down box for quickly exploring PROBE 
   methods A, B, and C.</li>

 <li>The Play/Pause button now has a drop-down menu for quickly jumping to a 
   task where you have recently logged time. If you often bounce back and 
   forth between tasks for different projects, this feature makes your life 
   easier.</li>

 <li>Numerous bug fixes make the Time Log Editor more robust.</li>

 <li>The Time Log Editor now makes it easy to quickly filter your view of the 
   time log to "Today", "This Week", or "This Month". Forward and backward 
   buttons let you scroll to look at different time periods.</li>

 <li>The play/pause button and the hierarchy menus now provide audible 
   feedback to help you keep track of whether the dashboard is timing or 
   paused.</li>

 <li>The previous version of the dashboard would only write entries to the 
   time log when you changed phases; now, the time log is updated 
   continually. The data in your time log and your project plan summary forms 
   is never more than a minute old.</li>

 <li>When you find yourself fixing several defects at once (which can happen 
   often due to "fix defects" and "related defects"), the dashboard provides 
   better assistance.  It automatically ensures that only one defect timer is 
   running at a time, and maintains a stack of "interrupted" defects.</li>

 <li>The Defect Log Editor now allows defects to be deleted. It also supports 
   quick filtering to see the defects which were injected or removed in a 
   given phase.</li>

 <li>Timer icons have been placed on the HTML forms to allow navigation among 
   the phases of development without having to reach all the way up to the 
   hierarchy menus.</li>

 <li>A method was added that will allow driving of the dashboard by another 
   program.  This will allow IDE developers to add support for the 
   dashboard from within their programming environments.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="para_1_8_4_"></a>1.8.4. Features new in version 1.2 (released April 20, 2001)</h3>

<ul>
 <li>The dashboard now includes support for ALL the standard PSP processes 
   (PSP0, PSP0.1, PSP1.0, PSP1.1, PSP2.0, PSP2.1, and PSP3.0). All of the 
   online PSP process scripts and forms have been edited to conform as 
   closely as possible to the originals in the PSP book.</li>

 <li>The dashboard now displays charts and reports! Choose the "Data Analysis"
   option on the "C" menu, and dozens of standard charts and reports are 
   available (including ALL the tables required by reports R3, R4, and R5, 
   and ALL the charts currently drawn by the SEI's "Student Workbook" Excel 
   spreadsheet). With a single click, export data to Excel for further 
   analysis.</li>

 <li>The PROBE tool is now simpler to use. Previously, it would allow you to 
   explore the correlation between any two data items; unfortunately, this 
   made it cumbersome for everyday use. Now, by default, it only displays the 
   data items traditionally used by the PSP PROBE methodology.</li>

 <li>The PSP0 - PSP1.1 processes now support optional "Design Review" and 
   "Code Review" phases.</li>

 <li>Errors in several calculations have been corrected. Also, the "To Date"
   data calculations have been completely revamped and are now working 
   properly.</li>

 <li>Data calculation efficiency has been improved.</li>

 <li>With the addition of the standard PSP processes, the SCR/DCR processes 
   are no longer shipped with the dashboard. If are a current dashboard user, 
   and you have been using the SCR/DCR processes, your existing SCR/DCR 
   projects WILL still work. If you wish to continue creating projects that 
   use the SCR/DCR processes in the future, please download the SCR/DCR 
   process separately.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="para_1_8_5_"></a>1.8.5. Features new in version 1.1 (released February 9, 2001)</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Version 1.1 contained enhancements that made the tool significantly 
   easier to install.</li>

<P>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>




<H3><a name="para_1_9_3_"></a>1.9.3. <A NAME="doc15_SEC2" HREF="#doc15_TOC2">Preamble</A></H3>

<P>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

</P>
<P>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

</P>
<P>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

</P>
<P>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

</P>
<P>
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

</P>
<P>
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

</P>
<P>
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

</P>
<P>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

</P>


<H3><a name="para_1_9_4_"></a>1.9.4. <A NAME="doc15_SEC3" HREF="#doc15_TOC3">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</A></H3>


<P>

<STRONG>0.</STRONG>
 This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<P>

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

<P>

<STRONG>1.</STRONG>
 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.
<P>

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<P>

<STRONG>2.</STRONG>
 You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<P>

<UL>

<LI><STRONG>a)</STRONG>
     You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

<P>
<LI><STRONG>b)</STRONG>
     You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
     parties under the terms of this License.

<P>
<LI><STRONG>c)</STRONG>
     If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
     notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
     a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
     these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
     License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
     does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
     the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
</UL>

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<P>

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.
<P>

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

<P>

<STRONG>3.</STRONG>
 You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:


<!-- we use this doubled UL to get the sub-sections indented, -->
<!-- while making the bullets as unobvious as possible. -->
<UL>

<LI><STRONG>a)</STRONG>
     Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

<P>
<LI><STRONG>b)</STRONG>
     Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
     cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
     customarily used for software interchange; or,

<P>
<LI><STRONG>c)</STRONG>
     Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
     to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
     received the program in object code or executable form with such
     an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
</UL>

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.
<P>

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
<P>

<STRONG>4.</STRONG>
 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

<P>

<STRONG>5.</STRONG>
 You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

<P>

<STRONG>6.</STRONG>
 Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

<P>

<STRONG>7.</STRONG>
 If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
<P>

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.
<P>

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.
<P>

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

<P>

<STRONG>8.</STRONG>
 If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

<P>

<STRONG>9.</STRONG>
 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.
<P>

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

<P>


<STRONG>10.</STRONG>
 If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.



<P><STRONG>NO WARRANTY</STRONG></P>

<P>

<STRONG>11.</STRONG>
 BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

<P>

<STRONG>12.</STRONG>
 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

<H3><a name="para_1_9_6_"></a>1.9.6. <A NAME="doc15_SEC4" HREF="#doc15_TOC4">How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</A></H3>

<P> If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</P>

<P>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</P>


<P><VAR>one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.</VAR><br>

<P>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

<P>You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software

<P>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>

<P>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:</P>

<P>
The hypothetical commands <SAMP>`show w'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`show c'</SAMP> should show
the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than <SAMP>`show w'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`show c'</SAMP>; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever
suits your program.

</P>
<P>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

<P>Planning a software project is just as important as planning any other

Engineering</I> Watts Humphrey devotes three chapters to planning 
activities.  This help topic will not rehash the ideas put forth there, but 
will simply serve as a reminder that planning is essential!</P>

<P>The Process Dashboard can provide some help in your planning activities.

<H2><a name="para_2_1_"></a>2.1. Entering process data</H2>
<P>There are two main ways of entering data into the Process Dashboard.  The 
first is through various input tools and dialogs provided by the dashboard 
(e.g. the <a href="#doc30_top">defect dialog</a>, the 
<A HREF="#doc29_top">time log editor</A>, etc.).</p>

<p>The second is through the various PSP forms.  The scripts and forms are 
provided through an integrated web interface.  See the <a href="#doc26_top">Accessing Process Scripts</a> help 
topic for more info on how to access the scripts and forms.  To find out more 
information about the different process scripts and forms that are available, 
see the <a href="#doc2_top">process scripts</a> help 
topic.</p>


<h3><a name="para_2_1_1_"></a>2.1.1. The nature of the dashboard forms</h3>
<P>The dashboard forms are implemented via static and sometimes dynamic HTML 
pages. Unlike the HTML forms you see on the internet, the forms on these HTML 
pages are "live" at all times, much like a spreadsheet. You can type values 
in the input fields and other fields will recalculate automatically, even if 
those fields are in different browser windows. There is no need to press any 
kind of "submit data" button.</P>

<P>After typing in a value, you must generally "leave" that input field to 
signal that you are finished entering information. Pressing the "Tab" key (to 
move to the next input field) or clicking anywhere else on the page is 
generally sufficient. As soon as the "input cursor" leaves the field in 
question, the dashboard will automatically pick up your data, recalculate 
related data items, and save your data for future sessions.</P>

<P>If you enter an invalid value for a data item (for example, typing "foo"
in an input field that is expecting a number), the dashboard will reject the 
invalid value and restore the previous value for that input field.</P>

<p>The dashboard uses various visual cues to show you where data is missing 
or where a calculated value could not be completed.  Here is a partial screen 
shot of the Size Estimating Template that shows several of the ways the 
dashboard indicates incomplete or bad data.  NOTE: this screen shot is from 
the Internet Explorer browser.  Your browser may not be color coded in 
exactly the same way.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/ShowMissingFields.png"></center></p>

<a name="doc17_missing"><P></a>When a required data value is <I>missing</I>, the 
dashboard will display "<code>?????</code>". This is an indication that you 
still need to enter a value for that data item. Therefore, you should ensure 
that there are no "<code>?????</code>" symbols in the Plan column of your 
project plan summary before marking the Planning phase complete. Similarly, 
make certain you fill in all missing values in the Actual column of your 
project plan summary before marking the project complete.</P>

<P>If the dashboard cannot recalculate a formula because the formula 
references a missing ("<code>?????</code>") or otherwise invalid data value, 
it will display "<code>#VALUE!</code>" as the result of the calculation.  
When you see "<code>#VALUE!</code>" in a dashboard form, it almost 
<I>always</I> means that there is a "<code>?????</code>" field somewhere that 
you still need to fill in.</P>

<P>If the dashboard recalculates a formula and encounters a divide-by-zero 
error, it will display "<code>#DIV/0!</code>" as the result of the 
calculation. Divide-by-zero errors are common when you first begin using the 
dashboard, since you will not have any historical data.</P>

<P>To make all this possible, the dashboard software actually contains a very 
small HTTP server embedded within it.  This server allows communication 
between the HTML pages and the process data that is tracked by the 
dashboard.  If you close the dashboard program while one of the HTML forms is 
open, the form will reset and display "<code>NO CONNECTION</code>". You can 
reestablish the connection simply by restarting the dashboard, then telling 
your browser to reload the HTML page.</P>

<H3><a name="para_2_1_2_"></a>2.1.2. Frozen Calculations</H3>

<P>If you edit the value in an input field, and related data items don't 
recalculate, the data is probably <I>frozen</I>. Remember that when you mark 
the planning phase of a PSP project complete, all the Planned data elements 
are baselined and stop recalculating.  Similarly, when you mark a PSP project 
complete, the Actual and To Date data elements will freeze and stop 
recalculating. So if you expect formulas to recalculate and they don't, check 
to make certain that the planning phase and the entire project are <U>not</U>
marked complete. For more information, see the <A HREF="#doc23_top">Data Freezing</A> help topic.</P>

<a name="doc17_unlock"></a><h3><a name="para_2_1_3_"></a>2.1.3. Read-only data fields</h3>

<P>The Process Dashboard automatically calculates many data elements for 
you.  Normally, these calculated data values are not directly editable, but 
rather they will update when other data elements to which they are related 
get updated.  If you are using Internet Explorer, these values are displayed 
with a grey background.</p>

<P>Sometimes you may decide that you want to override one or more of these 
calculated values.  You can "unlock" these read-only data elements by 
clicking on the "<u>Unlock read-only data</u>" link at the bottom of the 
page.  Unlocking read-only data will make all the elements on the page 
editable, allowing you to override calculated values with your own.</p>

<P>Unlocking read-only data is useful for times when you intentionally want 
to override a calculation, but it is not without risk.  Once you have 
overridden a calculation, it will no longer automatically update in response 
to changes in related data items.  In addition, related calculations may no 
longer add up like you would normally expect.  Therefore, this feature should 
be used with caution.</p>

<p>After you have overridden a calculation with some value, you may decide 
that you want the old calculation back.  Just type <code>DEFAULT</code> in 
the input field, and when you leave the field the old calculation will be 
restored.</p>

<a name="doc17_exporting"></a><h3><a name="para_2_1_4_"></a>2.1.4. Exporting form data</h3>

<p>When you open a dashboard form, the form connects to the process dashboard
to retrieve the most up-to-date values for all the data elements on the page.
If you choose the &quot;File <img src="Images/rarrow.png"> Save&quot;
option from your browser, you will find that only the form is saved; the values
contained in the form are not.  If you want to save an electronic copy of a
dashboard form (for example, to email to a coworker, or to save with project
documentation), click the "Export to HTML" link at the bottom of the page.  The
dashboard will create an HTML version of the form containing a <i>snapshot</i>
of your data.  This HTML snapshot can be saved using the &quot;File <img src="Images/rarrow.png"> Save&quot; option of your browser.</p>

<p>If you would like to perform additional analysis on the data in a 
dashboard form, use the "Export to Excel" link at the bottom of the page. 
This will open the form in Excel, where you can reference the data in Excel 
charts and equations. For more information on the Excel export feature, see 
the <A HREF="#doc36_excel">Exporting your 
data</A> help topic.</p>

<p><b>Important:</b> the Excel version of the form contains <i>exported</i>
data only.  If you edit values in the Excel spreadsheet, your changes will 
not be imported back into the Process Dashboard. To change a data value in 
the Process Dashboard, you must make the change in a dashboard form.</p>


<div></div><a name="doc18_top"></a>


<H2><a name="para_2_2_"></a>2.2. Using the hierarchy editor</h2>
<P>The hierarchy editor allows you to create a work breakdown structure for 
your work, and also defines the process elements that will be used for a 
given software project. The hierarchy editor can be opened by selecting the
"Hierarchy" option on the <a href="#doc32_top">configure
menu</a>.</P>

<P>Its basic function is to allow creation and deletion of nodes in a project 
tree.  You can create any arbitrary node structure to organize the different 
types of projects you are working on, and add project templates to the tree 
from the template files provided.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/HierarchyEditorStart.png"></center></p>

<P>When the hierarchy editor is started, it looks more or less like this.  In 
the screen shot shown, some child nodes have already been defined under both 
"Project" and "Non Project".</p>

<P>When the little tree control is pointing to the right, it indicates that 
the node can be expanded.  Clicking the tree control will cause the expansion 
of the tree.  When the control is pointing down, it indicates that the node 
is showing its expansion and can be collapsed.</p>

<h3><a name="para_2_2_1_"></a>2.2.1. The File menu</h3>

<P>The File menu provides the choices of Close, Save, and Revert.  Their 
functionality is pretty self-explanatory:  Close closes the editor, Save 
saves the changes to the dashboard project tree, and Revert will revert the 
project tree back to the state of the last save or to when the editor was 
opened.</p>

<h3><a name="para_2_2_2_"></a>2.2.2. The Edit menu</h3>

<P>The Edit menu provides some rudimentary editing control on the project 
hierarchy.  It provides the choices of Delete, Move Up, Move Down, Cut, Paste, Add Node, and Add Template.</P>

<P><B>Delete</B> will allow the deletion of a portion of the project tree.  
It deletes the selected node and all its children from the tree.  Be careful; 
deleted nodes and projects cannot be revived once you save your changes. 
Deleted projects will no longer contribute to your historical data. 
Therefore, you probably don't want to delete projects unless they contain no 
real data. If you find that many historical projects are cluttering up your 
hierarchy, your best strategy is to create a node in your hierarchy called 
&quot;Archived Projects,&quot; then use Cut and Paste to move completed 
projects there.</p>

<P><B>Move Up</B> and <B>Move Down</B> alter the relative position of the 
selected node in the tree. The selected node will still have the same parent, 
but it will appear earlier or later in the list of children for that parent. 
Since the <A HREF="#doc22_top">task and schedule</A> feature 
assumes that tasks will be performed in hierarchy order, Move Up and Move 
Down can help rearrange nodes so they appear in the order you plan to work on 
them.</p>

<P><B>Cut</B> and <B>Paste</B> can be used to move a node / project from one 
part of the tree to another. Simply highlight the node or project you wish to 
move, and choose Cut. Then highlight the new parent for the node or project, 
and choose Paste. The cut node (and all its children) will be relocated 
underneath the new parent. You can then use Move Up and Move Down to 
reposition the node relative to its siblings.</p>

<P><B>Add Node</B> allows insertion of nodes into the tree. Nodes created
in this way serve two general purposes:</p>

<OL>
  <LI>They behave like &quot;folders&quot;, which can contain other nodes
    and/or projects. This allows you to add organization to your work
    projects.</LI>
  <LI>They can be used to track time for process-less tasks like
    &quot;reading email.&quot; If your employer requires you to track your
    time for tasks like these, you can create an entire hierarchy of such
    nodes for time tracking purposes. These nodes will <B><U>not</U></B>
    interfere with your historical PSP project data - they will not
    contribute toward To Date calculations and they will not appear in PROBE 
   linear regressions.</LI>
</OL>

<P>Actual projects themselves should <em>NOT</em> be added in this way, but 
should be added via Add Template (see below).  The Add Node menu brings up a 
cascading second menu that provides the choices of Above, Below, and As 
Child.  Again, these are pretty self-explanatory: Above will add a node to 
the tree as a sibling to the selected node, and will place it above the 
selected node; Below will also add a sibling node, but will place it below 
the selected node; As Child will add a node as a child of the selected 
node.</p>

<P><B>Add Template</B> allows insertion of a process template into the tree.  
Use this choice when you are ready to define a project.  The Add Template 
menu brings up a cascading second menu that provides choices among the 
various defined processes.  By default, the 7 PSP process levels are 
provided, along with three others: <a href="#doc2_generic">Generic</a>, <a href="#doc2_timer">Timer</a>, and <A HREF="#doc40_top">Rollup PSP Data</A>.  If you 
have added any add-on process sets, other choices will appear as well.  For 
more information about the processes and their scripts, see the <a href="#doc2_top">process scripts</A> help topic.</p>

<P>When you insert a project template into the hierarchy, it will initially 
have a generic name like &quot;PSP2.1&quot;. You should feel free to change 
its name immediately to something more descriptive. (To make dashboard 
operation clear, this help document often displays projects with names like 
&quot;PSP0&quot;, but such bland project names are neither required nor 
expected for actual use.)</p>

<P>Any node in the project hierarchy can be renamed except for the process
elements themselves (i.e. Planning, Design, Code, etc.).  To rename a node,
click the node once to select it, then wait a moment and click it again to go
into edit mode.  The name will appear as a text entry.  You can hit return to
finish changing the name, or escape to cancel the name change. 
<b>Important:</b> Node names cannot contain the '/' character.</p>

<h3><a name="para_2_2_3_"></a>2.2.3. Process templates</h3>

<P>When a process template is added, all the process phase elements that are 
defined for that process will be automatically added as children.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/HierarchyEditorShowAddedPSP0.png"></center></p>

<P>These process phases cannot be edited in any way (with a couple 
exceptions).  If a process phase is selected and the Edit menu is clicked, 
the menu will show all entries greyed out and disabled.  This is to protect 
the integrity of the processes themselves.</p>

<h3><a name="para_2_2_4_"></a>2.2.4. Processes PSP0 - PSP1.1</h3>
<P>PSP processes PSP0 through PSP1.1 do not provide for design or code 
reviews, as those improvements are introduced in PSP level 2.  However, the 
dashboard will allow you to add design and or code reviews to these low level 
PSP processes if you choose.  If you pick on a project that was defined from 
the PSP0, PSP0.1, PSP1, or PSP1.1 process templates and then choose the "Add
Template" menu you will see Design Review and Code Review choices.  Either of
these can be added to the process.  They will be automatically inserted in the
correct places in the process phase order.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/HierarchyEditorShowPSP0Reviews.png"></center></p>

<p>Once you insert a Design Review or Code Review phase, it will appear in
the process scripts and forms for the project. If you later change your mind 
and decide you don't want the review phase after all, you can highlight it 
and choose Delete from the Edit menu.</p>

<a name="doc18_cyclic"></a><h3><a name="para_2_2_5_"></a>2.2.5. The PSP3 process</h3>
<P>The PSP3 process is a cyclic development process.  As such, it provides a 
basic structure for the whole project and also provides the ability to add 
development cycles.  When a PSP3 process is added to the hierarchy, it will 
have the basic skeletal structure defined (Planning, High Level Design, High 
Level Design Review, and Postmortem phases), along with one PSP3 cycle.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/HierarchyEditorShowEmptyPSP3.png"></center></p>

<P>Once you decide upon your cyclical development strategy, you should create 
additional cycles underneath the PSP3 project. Each of these cycles will 
contain the other PSP3 process phases (Design, Design Review, Code, Code 
Review, Compile, Test, and Reassessment).  The PSP3 cycles are added just 
like the PSP3 project itself, via the "Add Template" menu.  When a PSP3 based 
project is selected and the Edit menu is chosen, the Add Template menu item 
will have only one available choice: PSP3cycle.  The cycle will be placed 
appropriately before the Postmortem step.  You can input as many cycles as 
you would like in this manner.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/HierarchyEditorShowPSP3WithCycle.png"></center></p>


<div></div><a name="doc19_top"></a>

<H2><a name="para_2_3_"></a>2.3. Using the Size Estimating Template</H2>

<P>The Size Estimating Template is used to help make estimates of how big a 
new software project will be or how long it will take to create the project 
(size and time estimation).  It is patterned after the Size Estimating 
Template from Watts Humphrey's book <i>A Discipline for Sofware 
Engineering</i> (table C39).  The online version of this form takes advantage 
of dynamic HTML to make the form easier to use.</p>

<P>Here is the form as it appears for PSP1.1 and later processes (PSP1 lacks 
the time estimation section and only estimates program size)</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/SizeEstimatingTemplate.png"></center></p>

<P>Right near the top of the form is a link to bring up the Size Estimating 
Template instructions form (table C40).  The dashboard will bring up the 
instructions in a separate web browser so that the two can be placed side by 
side on your screen.</p>

<P>Also, there are several links on the form that will add rows to the form.  
If you need more room than the form provides, just click on the appropriate 
link and it will expand for you (so much better than paper!)</p>

<P>The header section contains entries for the name of the project and your 
name.  Both of these fields should be automatically filled in by the 
dashboard (if your name does not appear, go ahead and enter it -- it will 
show up on the other forms as well).</p>

<a name="doc19_baseLOC"></a><h3><a name="para_2_3_1_"></a>2.3.1. Base Program LOC</h3>

<P>The Base Program LOC section is where you enter the information about any 
base LOC that are going to go into your project.  The form has blanks for 
both ESTIMATED and ACTUAL sets of data.  When using this form for planning 
purposes, the ESTIMATED columns should get filled in.  After the project is 
finished and you are in the postmortem phase, you should enter data in the 
ACTUAL columns.</p>

<P>The form asks for the base LOC size, the number of deleted LOC, and the 
number of modified LOC.  In the base LOC entry, enter the number of LOC that 
will be used for the project that already exist at the time the project 
starts.  For example if you are creating a modification to an already 
existing program, the LOC from the existing program count as base LOC.</P>

<P>The form also asks for the number of deleted and the number of modified 
LOC.  These are LOC that were part of the base program that are either 
deleted or changed during the software project.</P>

<a name="doc19_objectLOC"></a><h3><a name="para_2_3_2_"></a>2.3.2. Object LOC</h3>
<P>The PSP tends to refer to all programming modules as objects.  If you are 
programming in an object oriented language such as C++, Java, or Smalltalk, 
then it makes sense to think in terms of real O-O objects.  If however you 
are programming in a non-object oriented language such as C, FORTRAN, or even 
BASIC, then it makes more sense to think in logical groupings of functionality 
such as functions or subroutines or procedures.</p>

<a name="doc19_baseAdditions"></a><h4><a name="para_2_3_2_1_"></a>2.3.2.1. Base Additions</h4>

<P>Base Additions LOC are lines added to objects/modules that already exist 
in the base program.  The form gives blanks for a description of the added 
code, the type of functionality that is being added, the number of methods 
that are going to be added of this type, the relative size of these methods, 
and estimates/measures of the LOC that are being added.</p>

<P>The type field is one of Calculation, Data, I/O, Logic, Setup or Text.  
Whichever of these categories best fits the type of new code that is being 
added should be chosen from the drop down.</p>

<P>The number of methods really only applies to object oriented and/or object 
based languages.  If you are not programming in such a language, you can 
simply put 1 in this entry to indicate that you are creating functions or 
subroutines.</p>

<P>The relative size pull down allows you to choose from subjective size 
categories such as Very Small, Small, Medium, Large, and Very Large.  The 
division between categories will vary by programming language and by your 
experience.  The categorization of relative size is only to help you in your 
estimates.  Watts Humphrey explains how to determine the cutoff for the 
various size categories in <i>A Discipline for Software Engineering</i>.

<P>In the estimated and actual LOC blanks you are to enter LOC amounts.  The 
table that Watts Humphrey provided for relating relative sizes to C++ LOC is 
available from the link marked "EST. LOC".  Again, only your data can direct 
how many LOC belong in each category.</p>

<P>The totals will update automatically as you enter your data.</p>

<a name="doc19_newObjects"></a><h4><a name="para_2_3_2_2_"></a>2.3.2.2. New Objects</h4>
<P>New Objects are probably where the bulk of new development will happen in 
most of your projects.  The entries are identical to those discussed in the 
Base Additions section with one exception.  Beside the estimated and actual 
LOC columns are columns of little checkboxes.  Put a check in these boxes if 
the new object on the corresponding line is considered a "New Reused" LOC.  
"New Reused" code is code that is sufficiently general purpose that it can be 
checked into a reuse library.  Generally this means more than just code that 
can probably be reused in the general sense.  It usually has to do with 
proper packaging of the code as well: Are proper interfaces defined?  Is the 
code sufficiently well documented?  Etc.</p>

<a name="doc19_reusedObjects"></a><h4><a name="para_2_3_2_3_"></a>2.3.2.3. Reused Objects</h4>
<P>Reused Objects are objects that are brought into the program from a reuse 
library.  The line between a reused object LOC and a base LOC can sometimes 
get blurry.  The main rule is that you must not count the same LOC as both 
base and reused.  The LOC counting formulas will not work out correctly in 
that case.</p> <!-- more to say here?  Or leave well enough alone? -->

<a name="doc19_time"></a><h3><a name="para_2_3_3_"></a>2.3.3. Performing the size/time estimation</h3>
<P>Once you have thought through all the changes that are going to be made to 
the software, you are ready to calculate a prediction of size and or time.  
The form will add up the Estimated Object LOC for you.  This is the
number that you will use as your base estimate in the PROBE method.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/ProbeWizardLink.png"></center></p>

<P>The Size Estimation Template offers a link that will allow you to choose 
the PROBE Wizard to help you make your estimates.  If you use the PROBE 
Wizard, it will read your Estimated Object LOC off the size estimating 
template automatically, and will save your chosen estimates back to the size 
estimating template automatically. For more information about using the PROBE 
Wizard, see the <a href="#doc20_top">Using the PROBE Wizard</a>
help topic.</p>

<P>On the other hand, if you use the PROBE tool, you will need to type the 
Estimated Object LOC into the Estimate field on the tool. Once you have 
investigated the relationships among your process data, you should manually 
copy your final estimates back to the size estimating template, along with 
the various other measures that come about as a result of the estimation 
(<i>B</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>B</i><sub>1</sub>, UPI, LPI, prediction range, 
r<sup>2</sup>, probe method selected). If you use PROBE method C or D, the 
Prediction Range field and the other numeric fields below it can be left 
blank. For more information about the PROBE tool provided by the dashboard, 
see the <a href="#doc21_top">Using the PROBE tool</a> help topic.</p>

<h3><a name="para_2_3_4_"></a>2.3.4. Entering Actual data during Postmortem</h3>

<P>Once you reach the Postmortem phase and you have the Actual data for LOC, 
you should return to this form to enter the actuals for the various measures 
on the form (base, deleted, modified, and total LOC, LOC counts for the 
various objects, etc.).</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/QSEnterActualLOC.png"></center></p>

<P>That's all the data that has to be entered on this form.  The dashboard 
calculates as much of the data for you as possible.  The numbers entered and 
calculated on this form will automatically appear on the Project Plan Summary 
form.</p>



<div></div><a name="doc20_top"></a>

<H2><a name="para_2_4_"></a>2.4. Using the PROBE Wizard</H2>

<P>The PROBE Wizard provides assistance in making estimates by guiding you 
through the common PROBE scenarios that are required in the various PSP 
scripts.  The PROBE Wizard can be opened by clicking on the link found on the 
<a href="#doc19_top">Size Estimating Template</a>.</p>

<p>When the PROBE Wizard is activated, it starts with a welcoming screen that 
reminds you of the nature of estimating with the PROBE method.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/QSProbeWizardStartup.png"></center></p>

<h3><a name="para_2_4_1_"></a>2.4.1. PROBE Wizard Step 1</h3>
<p>Step 1 in the PROBE method is to verify that the Estimated Object 
LOC number is accurate.  The Wizard shows you the number you have input on 
the Size Estimating Template and asks you to verify that this is indeed a 
good estimate.</p>

<h3><a name="para_2_4_2_"></a>2.4.2. PROBE Wizard Step 2</h3>
<p>Step 2 is to verify your historical data.  The PROBE Wizard puts up a 
table of numbers that shows your estimations from previous PSP projects.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/ProbeWizard2.png"></center></p>

<p>On this pane, you can exclude data points that you know to be "outliers"
statistically.  By clicking on the checkboxes at the end of each row, you can 
exclude any data point that you know does not represent your normal work 
processes.  If you are not completely sure about the consequences of 
excluding outlier data, you should probably leave all of the boxes 
unchecked.</p>

<h3><a name="para_2_4_3_"></a>2.4.3. PROBE Wizard Step 3</h3>
<p>Step 3 is to estimate the size of the new development effort.  The PROBE 
method (as implemented by the Process Dashboard) outlines 5 ways to estimate 
size:</p>

<p><table border=0 cellpadding=2 hspace=5>

 <tr valign="top"><td>A</td>
  <td>Estimate size based on a good correlation between previous Estimated 
   Object LOC data and Actual New and Changed LOC data. This method is the 
   most preferred method, but can only be used if you have sufficient data 
   that correlates well.</td>
 </tr>

 <tr valign="top"><td>B</td>
  <td>If Object LOC estimates do not correlate well enough to use method A, 
   PROBE suggests estimating size based on a good correlation between 
   previous Estimated New and Changed LOC data and Actual New and Changed LOC 
   data. Again, this method can only be used if you have sufficient data that 
   correlates well.</td>
 </tr>

 <tr valign="top"><td>C1</td>
  <td>If neither of the data pairings for methods A and B correlate, but you 
   do have Estimated Object LOC data, you can use that data to do the 
   estimate.  This method requires at least some Estimated Object LOC data be 
   recorded.</td>
 </tr>

 <tr valign="top"><td>C2</td>
  <td>If you do not have any Estimated Object LOC, but you do have Estimated 
   New and Changed LOC data, you can use that data to do the estimate.  This 
   method requires at least some Estimated New and Changed LOC data be 
   recorded.</td>

 <tr valign="top"><td>D</td>
  <td>If you have no historical data, method D just indicates that you should 
   use your best engineering judgement to make the estimate.</td></tr>
</table></p>

<p>The Wizard will present all of these possibilities to you in decreasing 
order of preference based on how well each method seems to track (or 
correlates) with your historical data.  You just have to choose the method 
you would like to follow by picking from a set of radio boxes.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/ProbeWizard3.png"></center></p>

<p>The Wizard also has links to explanatory help windows that will pop up and 
give you more detail about the different types of calculations that it is 
doing to generate the different estimates.  These links are shown in <font color="blue">blue text</font>.</p>

<h3><a name="para_2_4_4_"></a>2.4.4. PROBE Wizard Step 4</h3>
<p>Step 4 is very similar to step 3, except the estimation is for time 
instead of size.  The same basic set of methods is available, and the Wizard 
will offer each data estimate in decreasing order of preference.</p>

<p>The PROBE method (as implemented by the Process Dashboard) outlines 6 ways 
to estimate time:</p>

<p><table border=0 cellpadding=2 hspace=5>

 <tr valign="top"><td>A</td>
  <td>Estimate time based on a good correlation between previous Estimated 
   Object LOC data and Actual time data. This method is the most preferred 
   method, but can only be used if you have sufficient data that correlates 
   well.</td>
 </tr>

 <tr valign="top"><td>B</td>
  <td>If Object LOC estimates do not correlate well enough to use method A, 
   PROBE suggests estimating time based on a good correlation between 
   previous Estimated New and Changed LOC data and Actual time data. Again, 
   this method can only be used if you have sufficient data that correlates 
   well.</td>
 </tr>

 <tr valign="top"><td>C1</td>
  <td>If neither of the data pairings for methods A and B correlate, but you 
   do have Estimated Object LOC data, you can use that data to do the 
   estimate.  This method requires at least some Estimated Object LOC data be 
   recorded.</td>
 </tr>

 <tr valign="top"><td>C2</td>
  <td>If you do not have any Estimated Object LOC, but you do have Estimated 
   New and Changed LOC data, you can use that data to do the estimate.  This 
   method requires at least some Estimated New and Changed LOC data be 
   recorded.</td>

 <tr valign="top"><td>C3</td>
  <td>If you only have Actual Time and Size data, you can use that data to do 
   the estimate.</td>

 <tr valign="top"><td>D</td>
  <td>If you have no historical data, method D just indicates that you should 
   use your best engineering judgement to make the estimate.</td></tr>
</table></p>

<p>Unlike other wizards you may have used in the past, the PROBE Wizard 
updates the data in the dashboard whenever you click the Continue button to 
move onward (that is why there is no Cancel button on the Wizard).  If you 
make a mistake while using the Wizard, you'll have to use the Back button to 
go back and fix it, or make the change manually on the Size Estimating 
Template.  Of course, you can always just run the PROBE Wizard a second 
time.</p>

<h3><a name="para_2_4_5_"></a>2.4.5. PROBE Wizard Step 5</h3>

<p>At this point, you are finished making your estimates.  Step 5 encourages 
you to check the estimates to make sure that they make sense.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/ProbeWizard5.png"></center></p>

<p>Clicking Finish dismisses the PROBE Wizard.</p>

<h3><a name="para_2_4_6_"></a>2.4.6. A sanity check</h3>

<p>After you use various PROBE methods to independently generate your size 
estimate and your time estimate, it is always a good idea to "sanity check"
those estimates to ensure that they are reasonable and in synch with each 
other.  The final screen of the PROBE Wizard helps with this task.  It uses 
your size and time estimates to calculate your planned productivity, and then 
compares this number with your historical productivity to date.  When your 
planned productivity is significantly different than your historical 
productivity, it is usually a warning flag indicating that either your size 
estimate or your time estimate (or possibly both) is incorrect.  When this 
occurs, the PROBE wizard strongly encourages you to reexamine your 
estimates.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/ProbeWizardPoorEstimate.png"></center></p>

<p>If you rexamine your estimates and decide not to change them, you can 
simply close the PROBE Wizard (using the "X" in the window title bar). The 
estimates you chose for size and time will still appear on the Size 
Estimating Template.</p>


<div></div><a name="doc21_top"></a>

<H2><a name="para_2_5_"></a>2.5. Using the PROBE tool</H2>

<P>The PROBE tool provides assistance in making estimates by performing the 
PROBE calculations for you. The PROBE tool can be opened by selecting the
"PROBE" option on the <a href="#doc32_top">configure
menu</a>.</p>

<p>This version of the Process Dashboard also contains a PROBE Wizard that 
can help step you through the PROBE estimation process.  You can find out 
more about the PROBE Wizard by reading the <a href="#doc20_top">Using the PROBE Wizard</a> help topic.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/ProbeToolStart.png"></center></p>

<p>The PROBE tool is much more powerful than the PROBE Wizard. It can perform 
correlation tests and projections based on any two process data metrics.  The 
Method pull-down allows quick access to the different estimation methods 
provided by the PROBE estimation method.  Clicking on the pull-down gives the 
following choices:</p>

<P><center><img src="Images/ProbeToolMethods.png"></center></p>

<P>Choosing any of the standard PROBE methods will set the independent and 
dependent variables to their appropriate values.  The different methods are 
documented on the PROBE instructions form.</p>

<P>If you would like to explore correlations between any two other process 
metric variables, they can be chosen from the independent and dependent 
variable pull-downs.</p>

<P><a name="doc21_average"></a><a name="doc21_regression"></a>Basically the PROBE 
tool runs a correlation test on the two sets of data chosen.  It then reports 
the various statistical measurements on the dialog.  There are two types of 
measurements shown on the dialog: those that show relationships between the 
sets of data chosen (r<sup>2</sup>, p, Variance, Standard Deviation), and 
those that are related to a projection based on the estimate entered 
(<i>B</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>B</i><sub>1</sub>, Range, UPI and LPI).  Also there 
are two columns of data on the tool.  The left column shows data based on a 
linear regression (this is for methods A and B the PROBE estimation method) 
and the right column shows data based on how well your data seem to predict 
on the average (this is for the different C methods of the PROBE estimation 
method).</p>

<a name="doc21_probeDialogFilter"></a><h3><a name="para_2_5_1_"></a>2.5.1. Filtering your data set</h3>
<P>The filter button allows you to restrict the data set of the correlation 
and projection to certain projects.  It will pop up a tree view of the 
current projects stored and allow you to add or remove data items from the 
selected set.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/ProbeFilter.png"></center></p>

<p>Seleted items are marked with a graphical "X".  By default the tool only 
shows projects in the tree (nodes).  You can expand this view to include the 
process phases as well by choosing the "Show leaf nodes" box.  This will 
allow you to include or reject data from among different phases of projects.  
The Apply button applies your filtering selection to the numbers in the PROBE 
dialog.</p>

<h3><a name="para_2_5_2_"></a>2.5.2. Measures of correlation</h3>
<P>On a typical estimation, you will want to choose from the different 
combinations of correlations available to see if any of the data correlate 
well enough to be used for projections.  The PROBE tool will make this quite 
simple.  Just pick the two data sets you would like to correlate, and the 
numbers on the tool will update to show you the results. The key numbers to 
examine are the measure of correlation (r<sup>2</sup>) and the significance 
measurement (p).</p>

<a name="doc21_correlation"></a><h4><a name="para_2_5_2_1_"></a>2.5.2.1. The correlation measurement</h4>
<p>As detailed by Watts Humphrey, an r<sup>2</sup> value of over 0.5 
indicates that the numbers correlate well enough to use a linear regression 
method.  The degree of confidence as measured by the r<sup>2</sup> variable 
is shown on the dialog by its color.  When the value is too low to be used 
for predictive purposes, the r<sup>2</sup> value will show up in red.  Values 
that show better and better agreement are shown in different colors.  The 
colors used are: red (very bad), yellow/orange (fair), blue (good), and black 
(very good).</p>

<a name="doc21_significance"></a><h4><a name="para_2_5_2_2_"></a>2.5.2.2. The significance measurement</h4>
<p>The significance measurement is an indication of how significant the 
correlation is.  It is expressed in a percentage that represents the 
probability that this correlation could have happened by chance.  Low numbers 
mean that the data is probably showing a causality and can be used to make 
projections.  The same color scheme to show the relative "goodness" of the 
data is used here.</p>

<P>Both measures need to be taken into consideration before using a 
projection from a linear correlation.  There are some data combinations that 
can make one of the measurements look good while the other is bad.  For 
example if you have data that correlate well but the significance of that 
correlation is not very high, you could be looking at a random occurrence.</p>

<a name="doc21_interval"></a><a name="doc21_projection"></a><h3><a name="para_2_5_3_"></a>2.5.3. Making a projection</h3>
<P>To make a projection, just enter an estimate in the Estimate entry.  The 
estimate should be an estimate of the type of data that is chosen in the top 
pull down box marked "Correlate".  For example, you should put an estimated 
number of New &amp; Changed LOC in the entry if you are correlating against 
Estimated New &amp; Changed LOC.  The % range entry will allow you to change 
the confidence interval of the projection.  Most PSP work is done at a 70% 
confidence interval, but you can set this as high or as low as you would 
like.  Setting the confidence interval higher will give you a wider range of 
possible values, and setting the interval lower will narrow the range of 
possible values.</p>

<P>As you change the input parameters, the tool will relcalculate all the
numbers appropriately.  Some calculations may display ERROR if the data is
poorly correlated, or if there are not enough historical data points to
perform the calculation.
The projected estimate will show up at the top of both columns (the left 
column showing the projection using linear regression and the right column 
showing the projection based on an averaging technique).  It is up to you to 
decide which numbers are appropriate for making the projection.</p>

<a name="doc21_probeDialogChart"></a><h3><a name="para_2_5_4_"></a>2.5.4. Visualizing the data</h3>
<P>The PROBE tool also offers a scatterplot of your process data.  This view 
is chosen by clicking on the "Chart" button.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/ProbeChart.png"></center></p>

<P>The plot will show a scatterplot of the data being used for the regression 
calculations and two lines passing through the data.  A blue line shows the 
line as projected from <i>B</i><sub>0</sub> and <i>B</i><sub>1</sub>
calculated using linear regression, and a red line shows the line as 
projected from the averaging calculation.  Only one of these lines will be in 
color if you've chosen one of the standard PROBE estimating methods.  In this 
case, the other line is shown in grey.  If you choose a custom estimation 
method (i.e. you are comparing different sets of data than what the PROBE 
method calls for) both lines will show in color.  Many times this visual 
representation of the data can provide insights that straight numbers may 
not.</p>

<P>The three columns below the plot display the actual values used for the 
data plotted.  The first column contains the project name, and the second and 
third columns show the data values for the X and Y axes respectively.</p>

<H2><a name="para_2_6_"></a>2.6. Using the Task &amp; Schedule Tool</H2>

<P>The task and schedule tool allows you to generate a schedule for 
completing tasks, and track progress against that schedule using earned 
value. You can open the task and schedule tool by selecting the 
&quot;Task &amp; Schedule&quot; option on the
<a href="#doc32_top">configure menu</a>.</P>

<P>If you haven't created any schedules, the dashboard will immediately
jump to the Create New Schedule dialog which will allow you to create one. 
If you have already created at least one schedule, a Task &amp; Schedule
chooser window will appear.</P>

<p><center></a><img src="Images/TaskScheduleChooser.png"></center></p>

<p>This window displays all the schedules you have created. After you click
on a schedule to highlight it, you can use the buttons along the bottom to
open it, rename it, or delete it. The Cancel button will close this window.</p>

<p>Clicking the New button will create a new schedule. The dashboard will ask 
you to enter a name for the new schedule.  This allows you to track different 
schedules from within the dashboard. When a new schedule is first created, an 
empty Task &amp; Schedule window will appear prompting you for the first task 
you want to add to the schedule.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/AddTaskToSchedule.png"></center></p>

<p>All the tasks that are to be tracked within the schedule must come from 
the project hierarchy defined using the <a href="#doc18_top">Hierarchy Editor</a>.  You can track 
progress against PSP projects, projects you have made using custom process 
scripts or add-on process sets, or even against just a hierarchy of task 
names that are not associated with a particular process in the dashboard.  
The Task &amp; Schedule tool is completely process independent.</p>

<P>The Task &amp; Schedule window combines the PSP Task Planning Template 
(table C47) and the Schedule Planning Template (table C49) into one window.  
The top portion of the window gives a view of the task schedule on a task by 
task basis and tracks metrics about each task.  The bottom portion of the 
window is concerned with actual calendar time.  The time for the schedule is 
broken out into time periods (e.g. weeks) and the columns track metrics about 
each time period.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/TaskSchedule.png"></center></p>

<p>Editable values appear with a yellow background. If you are unfamiliar 
with the various columns in the task and schedule planning templates, you can 
hover the pointer over the column headings and a tool tip will tell you what 
the abbreviated heading stands for.</p>

<P>While this help topic won't get into all the details of earned value 
tracking, briefly here are the items that are shown in the upper window:</p>

<p><b>Planned Time (PT):</b> This is the amount of time you have planned for 
the given task.</p>

<p><b>Time</b> This is the actual amount of time spent on a given task.</p>

<p><b>Planned Value (PV):</b> This is the amount of earned value that will be 
earned by the given task based on the planned numbers.</p>

<p><b>Cumulative Planned Time (CPT):</b> This is the amount of time for the 
given task, including all tasks that are before it in the task list.</p>

<p><b>Cumulative Planned Value (CPV):</b> This is the Planned Value analog of 
the CPT column.  It shows the amount of planned value for the given task 
including all tasks that are before it in the task list.</p>

<p><b>Plan Date:</b> This is the date that the Task &amp; Schedule tool thinks 
you will finish the given task.  This number uses the data from the lower 
half of the Task &amp; Schedule tool to determine an ending date.</p>

<p><b>Date:</b> This is the actual completion date.  It will be filled in 
automatically when you mark the task complete via the <a href="#doc28_top">Completion Button</a></p>

<p><b>Earned Value (EV):</b> This is the actual amount of earned value that 
this task has earned.  <i>Remember that earned value measures are not counted 
until the task is marked as complete.</i></p>

<p>Briefly, here are the items that are shown in the bottom window:</p>

<p><b>From:</b> This is the starting date for a portion of your work 
schedule.  The schedule can start anytime and can be of just about any length 
(one week in duration, one day, one month, etc.).</p>

<p><b>To:</b> This is the ending date for a portion of your work schedule.  
Using the From and To fields, you can break your schedule up into managable 
time chunks.  The Task &amp; Schedule tool defaults to using time periods of 
one week in length.</p>

<p><b>Planned Direct Time (PT):</b> This is the amount of time that will be 
applied to the tasks in the task list during the calendar time period 
selected by the From and To fields.  It defaults to 20 hours, but can be set 
to whatever number you think is accurate for the amount of time you will 
actually spend on task <i>during the given time period</i>.  Note that this 
is the total amount of time you plan on spending on <i>ALL</i> of the tasks 
listed in the top window.  The default numbers on the Task &amp; Schedule 
tool work out to 20 hours per week of work on task.</p>

<p><b>Cumulative Planned Direct Time (CPT):</b> This is the Planned Direct 
Time of the given time period, plus the times of all previous periods.</p>

<p><b>Cumulative Planned Value (CPV):</b> This shows cumulatively the amount 
of earned value that is planned for the given time period.</p>

<p><b>Actual Direct Time (Time):</b> This shows the actual amount of direct 
time spent on the tasks in the schedule during the given time period.</p>

<p><b>Cumulative Actual Direct Time (CT):</b> This shows the actual amount of 
direct time spent on task during the given time period cumulatively.</p>

<p><b>Actual Cumulative Earned Value (EV):</b> This shows the amount of earned 
value actually earned during the given time period cumulatively.</p>


<h2><a name="para_2_7_"></a>2.7. Creating a schedule step by step</h2>

<p>The Task &amp; Schedule tool tries to make entering all the data necessary 
for project planning and tracking as painless as possible.  It fills in many 
of the columns automatically. The following discussion will show how to 
create a schedule step by step.</p>

<h3><a name="para_2_7_1_"></a>2.7.1. Step 1: Add tasks to the task list</h3>

<p>To create a schedule, you decide what tasks you want included in the 
schedule, and add them with the Add Task button. You can add any node in 
your hierarchy to the task list; it will be added, along with all its 
children, recursively. As an improvement over the traditional task planning 
template, the dashboard displays your task list in a hierarchical fashion. 
You can expand and contract this hierarchical view to get coarser- or 
finer-grained data. </p>

<h4><a name="para_2_7_1_1_"></a>2.7.1.1. The relationship between the Hierarchy Editor and the Task &amp; Schedule 
tool</h4>

<p>It is also worth pointing out that if you edit your hierarchy in the 
future (using the <a href="#doc18_top">hierarchy editor</a>), 
your changes will automatically propagate into affected task lists. For 
example, if you add a node named "Release 3.0" to a task list, then in the 
future if you were to create/delete subtasks underneath "Release 3.0", they 
would automatically appear in the task list / disappear from the task 
list.</p>

<p>Changes made in the hierarchy automatically get reflected into the 
schedule, because the schedule is basically a listing of the tasks/projects 
in the dashboard.  However, if you delete a task in the Task &amp; Schedule 
tool, it does <i>NOT</i> get deleted from the task hierarchy of the process 
dashboard (as defined using the <a href="Topics/Planning/UsingHierarchyEditor">Hierarchy 
Editor</a>).  All you will have done is removed the task from the schedule, 
not deleted it entirely from the dashboard.  Deletion of tasks or projects 
from the dashboard itself must be done from the <a href="#doc18_top">Hierarchy Editor</a>.</p>

<h4><a name="para_2_7_1_2_"></a>2.7.1.2. Editing the task list</h4>

<p>Once you have added tasks to the task list, you can use the Delete Task 
button to remove them, and the Move Task Up/Down buttons to alter their 
relative order. Note that these options are only available for the 
<U>top-level</U> tasks. (Top-level tasks are the tasks that you explicitly 
added using the Add Task button; in the task list, they appear as immediate 
children of the root of the tree.) At this time it is not possible to delete 
sub-tasks from your task list or change their relative order. If you want to 
do either of these things, you have two choices:</P>

<ul>
 <li>Make the changes in the hierarchy editor (for example, moving nodes up 
   or down to change the relative ordering of tasks)</li>
 <li>Manually add all the subtasks to the task list as top-level tasks 
   instead of adding their parent to the task list.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should generally try to put the tasks in chronological order (the 
first task in the list should be the one you plan to work on first, and so 
on).</p>

<H3><a name="para_2_7_2_"></a>2.7.2. Step 2: Estimate task time </H3>

<P>Once tasks are added to the task list, the dashboard will look up 
information like the planned time, actual time, etc. from the appropriate 
Project Plan Summary forms (if applicable) , and display it in the 
appropriate boxes. You can click on any value with a yellow background and 
edit it, and the change will appear immediately on the associated Project 
Plan Summary form.  Similarly, if you edit one of these values on a Project 
Plan Summary form, the new value will automatically appear here in the task 
list.</P>


<H3><a name="para_2_7_3_"></a>2.7.3. Step 3: Estimate calendar time</H3>

<P>To generate a schedule, the dashboard needs to know how much time you plan 
to spend working on these tasks, and when you plan to spend it. This 
information is displayed in the bottom portion of the window. Each row in the 
table represents a time period. These time periods are consecutive; each time 
period begins when the previous time period ends.</P>

<P>Think about how much time you have available to work on the tasks listed 
in your task list. Describe a time period by entering the dates it will start 
and stop, and in the "PT" (Planned Time) column enter the number of hours you 
think you can spend during that time period.</P>

<P>Most of the time people have fairly predictable schedules - for example, 
you might say "I'm going to spend 20 hours a week on this until it gets 
done." Since this is the most common situation, the schedule will, by 
default, grow automatically to meet the demand. You don't have to manually 
add rows to your schedule until there are enough hours to cover the tasks - 
instead, the schedule template will automatically duplicate the final row in 
the table until there are enough hours. You can easily see where the 
automatic portion of the schedule starts because the automatic rows are 
displayed with a medium gray font. Thus, the black rows in the schedule 
template are rows that you have manually created/edited, and the gray rows 
are the ones which have been automatically added to meet the time 
requirements.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/TaskScheduleTimes.png"></center></p>

<p><A NAME="doc22_shortSchedule"></A>You can disable this automatic schedule 
expansion simply by making the final manual row in your schedule contain zero 
planned hours.  The dashboard recognizes that infinite duplications of the 
"zero" row will not help you get any more hours, so it leaves the schedule 
short and assigns some of your tasks the planned completion date of 
"never".</p>

<P>As in the task list, editable cells have a yellow background.  Since time 
periods are contiguous, editing the "To" value on one row will cause the 
"From" value on the following row to change accordingly.  Similarly, editing 
the "From" value on one row will cause the "To" value on the previous row to 
change. If you make changes to the last black row (which is used as a 
template and copied to make all the subsequent gray rows), all of the gray 
rows will be regenerated accordingly. If you edit a value in one of the gray 
rows, it (and all of the rows before it) will become "real", and the row in 
question will become the new "template row" upon which subsequent gray rows 
will be based.</P>

<P>If you need to extend the schedule past its optimal completion date, click 
the Add Row button to create a new row at the bottom of your schedule. The 
Insert Row button will split the currently selected time period into two 
separate rows, while the Delete Row will merge the currently selected time 
period with the one that follows it. Note that it isn't possible to delete 
an automatically generated row. If you want to to force your schedule to 
end early, you should do so by entering 0 planned hours for the final time 
period, as described <A HREF="#doc22_shortSchedule">above</A>.</P>

<a name="doc22_progress"></a><H3><a name="para_2_7_4_"></a>2.7.4. Step 4: Track your progress</H3>

<P>With the list of tasks and the calendar of available time in place, the 
dashboard will calculate planned completion dates for each task. As you work, 
you should:</P>

<UL>
 <LI>Accurately log time against tasks using the <A HREF="#doc27_top">Play/Pause button</A> and the <A HREF="#doc29_top">Time Log Editor</A>. Time 
   logged against tasks in your task list will appear in the Actual Time
   columns of the task list and schedule list.</LI>
 <LI>Mark tasks complete using the <A HREF="#doc28_top">Completion Checkbox</A>. When 
   tasks are marked complete, the completion date will appear in the task 
   list, and you will earn the planned value for that task.</LI>
</UL>

<P></a>While your project is in progress, you can click on the "Chart" button 
for access to earned value charts and numerical analyses:</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/TaskChartValue.png"></center></P>

<P><center><img src="Images/TaskChartStats.png"></center></p>

<P>If you prefer, you can view this information in HTML, and even export it 
Excel, by clicking the Report button.</p>

<H3><a name="para_2_7_5_"></a>2.7.5. The Save Button</H3>

<p>If you edit the schedule or the list of tasks, you will need to click the 
Save button to save your changes. If you edit yellow-background values in the 
task list, however, those changes will be saved transparently; pressing the 
save button is not necessary.</p>

<HR>

<H3><a name="para_2_7_6_"></a>2.7.6. Potential mistakes</H3>

<P>Be careful to avoid making the following mistakes when creating a 
schedule:</P>

<P><B>Duplicate tasks:</B> Nothing currently prevents you from adding the 
same task to your task list more than once. This could easily happen, for 
example, if you add a task to your task list, then add its parent as well.  
If you do this, the dashboard will dutifully create a schedule as if you were 
performing the task twice.</P>

<P><B>Conflicts between different schedules:</B> The dashboard lets you 
create multiple, independent schedules. It does not, however, offer any 
support for time management when multiple schedules are running concurrently. 
Nothing prevents you from creating twelve different concurrent schedules, and 
promising to spend 40 hours per week on each.  Also, nothing prevents you 
from adding one task to multiple different schedules.</P>

<P><B>Time estimates that don't add up:</B> The Planned Time (PT) column 
should always add up in a hierarchical manner; that is, the planned time for 
a parent node should always be equal to the sum of the planned times for all 
its children. This is almost always the case for the PSP processes that come 
with the dashboard. However, if you have <A HREF="#doc17_unlock">unlocked</A> your data and overwritten 
calculations, times may no longer sum up correctly. When this occurs, the 
task list will use the children's plan time for calculations rather than the 
parent's.</P>

<P><B>Calendar starts too late:</B> If some of the tasks in your task list 
were completed <I>before</I>the start of the first time period in your 
schedule, or if you have logged time to some of the tasks in your task list 
<I>before</I>the start of the first time period in your schedule, then some 
of the earned value calculations will be incorrect. You can easily spot this 
problem because the "Actual" lines for the "Earned Value" and/or "Direct 
Hours" charts will not start at zero.</P>

<P>The dashboard automatically checks for some of these errors, and
displays an warning if they are found. If errors are present, they
will be highlighted with red text. If you hover the mouse over the red
text, a tool tip will provide a short description of the problem. For
a more complete explanation of the problem, click the red "Errors"
button that appears at the bottom of the task &amp; schedule window.


<div></div><a name="doc23_top"></a>

<H2><a name="para_2_8_"></a>2.8. Data Freezing</H2>

<P>By default, the dashboard will "freeze" appropriate pieces of data when
the corresponding project phase is marked as completed.  The two points
where this happens are at the end of the Planning phase and at the end of
the project.</p>

<P>In PSP process levels 0.1 and above, when you are planning your project 
the dashboard will use your historical data to help you create an estimate of 
how your total time will be distributed across the process phases.  Once you 
click the completion checkbox to complete the planning phase, all your 
Planned data will be baselined. The estimates you entered for size and time, 
along with all the calculated computed data elements for estimated data, will 
be frozen so that your planned data will always stay constant (if you really 
want to know more about why this is necessary, read the <a href="#doc23_gory">gory 
details</a> section).</p>

<P>Similarly, when you mark the project complete, the To Date numbers will be 
brought up to date and frozen.  This will enable you to view this report 
again in the future without having the To Date numbers changing in the 
report.</p>

<P>One side effect of the freezing of data is that if you want to change
your time or size estimate, you will have to navigate back to the Planning
phase and mark it as incomplete by clicking the completion checkbox again.
Once it has been marked as incomplete the dashboard will allow you to enter
a different estimate.</p>

<p>The same is true of the To Date items on the report.  If you navigate back
to an old project and start logging time to it, the Actual columns will
update as required, but the To Date columns will not.  You will need to mark
the project as incomplete so that the To Date items will thaw out and
recalculate.</p>

<p>The Project Completion checkbox is located on the Project Plan Summary 
form.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/QSCheckProjectComplete.png"></center></p>

<a name="doc23_gory"></a><h3><a name="para_2_8_1_"></a>2.8.1. The gory details</h3>

<P>The "To Date" elements on the forms are set up to always recalculate 
themselves based on all the completed data in the dashboard's database.  This 
is fine for most circumstances.  However, if you ever want to go back and 
look at a Project Plan Summary form (or other report or chart) from an older 
completed project, the dashboard would recalculate those To Date elements all 
over again.  This time the calculation would include data that was not 
available at the time the project was originally finished.  This would 
preclude anyone from being able to reproduce a previous Project Plan Summary 
accurately.</p>

<P>Actually, it gets a bit worse.  Since the estimates of time spent in each 
of the process phases is based on the To Date data, all the estimates would 
be changing on those older forms as well.</p>

<p>In fact, even within a project once you had planned your estimates for 
time in the various phases, those planned times would immediately change on 
the Project Plan Summary at the end of the project when you completed it.  
If the Planned data were still live, the current project's data would be 
incorporated back into those estimates!</p>

<P>The way we chose to deal with this problem is to introduce the freezing of 
data elements.  Now, once your planning is finished the data will freeze and 
not be "corrupted" by the finishing of the current project.  Also it becomes 
possible to recreate older Project Plan Summary forms since their formulas 
won't be changing anymore.</p>

<P>If you do not desire this kind of behavior (e.g. you always want the To 
Date items to reflect the current situation) you can turn off this behavior 
by setting the <code>dataFreezing.disabled</code> option in the configuration 
file.  For more information about the configuration file and what can be set 
there, see the <a href="#doc39_top">configuration file</a> help 
topic.</p>

<H1><a name="para_3_"></a>3. Running the dashboard</H1>

<P>Both the PSP and the TSP require the collection and analysis of metrics at 
a <i>very</i> fine-grained level. Once data are collected at this level, 
statistical analyses of the data permit remarkable planning, tracking, 
prediction, and control of software products and projects.</p>

<p>These metrics collection and analysis processes, however, are not trivial. 
In any real-world project, tool support for the PSP and TSP become important 
considerations. Although studies have demonstrated that people can maintain 
their productivity when using the PSP without tool support, the "frustration 
factor" inherent with such an approach tries the patience of all but the most 
disciplined engineers, making PSP behaviors difficult to sustain.</p>

<P>The Process Dashboard was designed to facilitate a solution to this 
problem.  When using the dashboard, the metrics required by the PSP can be 
measured quickly, easily, and accurately.</p>

<H2><a name="para_3_1_"></a>3.1. Navigating the hierarchy menus</H2>

<P>The dashboard attempts to keep itself as small as possible to allow the bulk 
of precious screen real estate to be used for the actual business of software 
development.  As different sections of the project tree are selected via the 
hierarchy menus, the dashboard will automatically resize itself to accommodate
the menu depth necessary to show the chosen process phase.</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/ShowHierarchyMenus.png"></center></p>

<P>The hierarchy menus are the way you choose the current working project.  
This example shows the dashboard ready to work on the Design phase of a 
PSP0 project.  The hierarchy menus show each level in the current project 
tree all the way down to the current phase.</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/HierarchyEditor.png"></center></p>

<P>To better illustrate navigation with the hierarchy menus, this fake set of 
projects will be used.  The project tree is shown in a screenshot from the 
hierarchy editor.  For more information on putting together a project 
hierarchy and the use of the hierarchy editor see the <a href="#doc18_top">Using the hierarchy editor</a>
help topic.</P>

<P>This project hierarchy shows two top level project categories: "Project"
and "Non Project".  These are the two categories given as default when the 
dashboard is first run.  Under "Project" there are three projects defined: 
"PSP0" and "Web project" along with a hierarchy node: "Palm".  Presumably 
this developer will be doing several projects in the future that fall under 
the logical category of "Palm".  At this point only one is shown: "Palm 
DB".  In this screenshot, only the Web project has been expanded to show its 
phases.  Phases are added into the project hierarchy as children of a 
project.  Web project was created from a PSP2.1 template, and so it has all 
the development phases of a PSP2.1 project.</P>

<P>Back on the dashboard itself, when the first hierarchy menu is selected, 
it will show all the entries in the project hierarchy that are defined at 
that level.  In this case it shows the two default nodes "Project" and "Non 
Project".</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/HierarchyMenus1.png"></center></p>

<P>Selecting the second hierarchy menu shows the entries defined at that 
level under the selection from the first menu.  In this case, the user has 
selected "Project" on the first menu, so the second menu shows the children 
of "Project" in the project hierarchy.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/HierarchyMenus2.png"></center></p>

<P>Selecting any menu in the set of hierarchy menus will show the entries 
defined as children under the selection on the menu to its left.  This final 
example shows the PSP 2.1 process phases that are defined for the "Web 
project".</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/HierarchyMenus3.png"></center></p>

<P>To help you keep track which tasks have marked complete, the hierarchy
menus display small checkmarks next to completed items. (You can mark an
item complete with the <A HREF="#doc28_top">completion checkbox</A>.)</P>

<div></div><a name="doc26_top"></a>

<H2><a name="para_3_2_"></a>3.2. Accessing the Process Scripts</H2>
<P>Most of the scripts necessary to perform your work are already included in 
the Process Dashboard.  In particular, the process scripts for all of the PSP 
levels described in <I>A Discipline for Software Engineering</I> are included.</P>

<P>To access process scripts, hit the script button on the dashboard.</P>

<P><center><IMG SRC="Images/PointToScriptButton.png"></center></P>

<P>This will start a web browser (if necessary) and point it at an 
appropriate process script based on which process stage is currently active.</P>

<P><center><IMG SRC="Images/PSP0DevelopmentScript.png"></center></P>

<P>This example shows a project calling up the Development script for PSP 
level 0.</P>

<P>When you click the script button, it will generally display the script for
the phase which is currently selected by the hierarchy menus.  Most of the
online forms allow you to navigate back to the "top" of the set of process
scripts by a link labelled "Top".  Also, a link which will take you on to the
next phase in the given process is usually shown as well.</P>

<a name="doc26_scriptIcons"></a><h3><a name="para_3_2_1_"></a>3.2.1. <A NAME="doc26_pullDown"></A>The script button pull-down</h3>
<P>The script button pull-down tab allows you to choose a particular form in 
a more direct manner.  Clicking the pull-down on the forms button will bring 
up a menu of the most commonly used scripts and forms available for the current process.  Choosing 
one of these will open the named script or form.</p>

<P><center><img src="Images/PointToScriptPullDownShowMenu.png" width="296" height="232"></center></p>

<a name="doc26_scriptBrowser"></a><P>You can also select the &quot;More...&quot;
option at the bottom of the menu to bring up a script browser. The
script browser shows your hierarchy on the left; when you highlight a
node in the hierarchy, it displays the available scripts and forms on
the right. You can open one of those scripts or forms by
double-clicking on it.</p>

<P ALIGN="center"><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="Images/ScriptBrowser.png" WIDTH="342" HEIGHT="291"></p>

<P>The script browser makes it easy to pull up forms for historical
projects without first needing to navigate the hierarchy menus to that
project.</p>

<h3><a name="para_3_2_2_"></a>3.2.2. The timing icons</h3><P>Many of the process 
scripts contain little stopwatch icons on them.  These icons provide another 
way to navigate and time a process phase.  When you click on one of these 
icons, the current phase being measured will change to the phase indicated by 
the icon and the timer will start measuring time for that phase.</p>

<H3><a name="para_3_2_3_"></a>3.2.3. External documents</H3>

<P>Creating or obtaining documents is often an integral part of performing
a process. The dashboard process scripts sometimes provide hyperlinks for
these documents. If you click on a document hyperlink, the dashboard will:</p>

<OL>
  <LI>Possibly ask you for pertinent information. For example, the
    dashboard may need to know the name of a directory where it should
    store documents     for this project, and it may display a form
    requesting that information. Once you provide this information and
    click &quot;OK,&quot; the dashboard generally won't have to ask for it
    again.</LI>
  <LI>Check to see if the file already exists. If not, it may be able to
    create the file from a template.</LI>
  <LI>Open the file for editing.</LI>
</OL>

<h3><a name="para_3_2_4_"></a>3.2.4. Entering data into the forms</h3>

<P>The various forms necessary to do your work have data entry fields which 
are to be used to capture the various process metrics.  The forms are 
continually "live", which means they are always ready and waiting for input.  
There is no "submit" or "send" button on the forms.  Just enter the data in 
the blanks and the dashboard will record it. Some blanks on the forms are greyed out.  These data elements are computed 
by the dashboard and do not require data input. For more information, see
the <A HREF="#doc17_top">Entering data</A> help topic.</P>

<H2><a name="para_3_3_"></a>3.3. Using the play/pause button</H2>

<P>The play/pause button gives access to the timer that is built into the 
dashboard.</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/PointToPlayPauseButton.png"></center></p>

<P>The dashboard timer makes it easy to measure the amount of time spent in 
the various phases of your development process.  When you start the timer, it
will automatically make appropriate entries in your <a href="#doc29_top">time log</a> for the project/task which you
have made active with the <a href="#doc25_top">hierarchy
menus</a>.</P>

<P>By default, the play/pause button shows a triangle when the timer <em>IS 
NOT</em> running.  The intent is that the picture shows what will happen when 
it is pressed (pressing the play button will cause the timer to start).  Once 
pressed, the button image changes from the triangle to a pair of vertical 
bars.  When the vertical bars are displayed, the timer <em>IS</em> running.  
Again, the intent is to show what will happen when the button is pressed at 
this point (pressing the pause button will cause the timer to pause).</P>

<p><img src="Images/DashboardStopped.png"></p>
Dashboard timer waiting to be started

<p><img src="Images/DashboardRunning.png"></p>
Dashboard timer running

<P>If you would prefer to see the triangle when the timer <em>IS</em>
currently running (i.e. you would rather see the current state of the timer 
on the button), you can override this default behavior by adding an entry to 
the configuration file.  Adding the following line to the configuration file 
will cause the play and pause symbols to reverse their meaning:</P>

<pre>pauseButton.showCurrent=true</pre>

<P>For more information about the configuration file see the <a href="#doc39_top">configuration file</a> help 
topic.</P>

<p>It is <b>not</b> necessary to stop the timer before using the hierarchy
menus to change the active project/task/phase.  You can leave the timer in
"play" mode as you move from one phase to another, and it will properly
finalize one entry in the time log, and open another.</p>

<a name="doc27_timelogdelay"></a><p>When the timer is running and you first navigate
to an activity, you will notice that the dashboard will not create an entry in
the time log until you have spent a full minute there; this is by design.
Navigating from one task to another may require multiple interactions with the
hierarchy menus, which necessarily implies that the "active" project/task will
momentarily pass through several intermediate states before finally arriving at
the desired task.  You would <u>not</u> want the dashboard to create extraneous
entries in the time log for all those intermediate tasks; therefore, the
dashboard waits and creates the time log entry only after you have logged 60
seconds worth of elapsed time to an activity.</p>

<a name="doc27_sound"></a><P>When you start the timer, it will make a short 
"clicking" sound to let you know it is timing you.  You can leave the timer 
running as you move from phase to phase and project to project, and it will 
play the "timing sound" as you navigate to each new project/phase.  Once 
again, the sound is there to remind you that the dashboard is timing you; the 
sound will <b>not</b> play if the timer is not running.  Therefore, as you 
move from one project/phase to another, if you expect to hear the sound and 
do not (or vice versa), check the state of the timer.</p>

<a name="doc27_pullDown"></a><h3><a name="para_3_3_1_"></a>3.3.1. The play/pause button pull-down control</h3>
<P>The play/pause button contains a pull-down control that can be used to
quickly jump to a point on the project tree where you have recently recorded
time.  This provides another way of navigating to a project or project phase
in which you were recently working.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/PointToPlayPausePullDownShowMenu.png"></center></p>

<P>In this example, the dashboard has already recorded time in both the 
Design and Planning phases of the project.  If one of these items is chosen, 
the dashboard will jump to that phase and continue.  If the timer is 
currently running it will stop in the current phase recording the elapsed 
time, switch to the chosen phase, and start recording time in the newly 
chosen phase.</p>

<!-- DISCLAIMER -->

<P>The items in the pull-down are not limited to the phases of the current
project. Therefore, the pull-down control is very useful when you are
juggling several activities. If you keep bouncing back and forth between
several unrelated activities, you can quickly jump to a recent activity and
log time there by using the pull-down menu.</P>


<div></div><a name="doc28_top"></a>

<H2><a name="para_3_4_"></a>3.4. Using the completion checkbox</H2>

<P>As you complete the activities for a given process phase, you should mark
that phase as completed via the completion checkbox.</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/PointToCompletionButton.png"></center></p>

<P>When the completion checkbox is pressed, the dashboard moves the current 
phase to the next phase prescribed by the running process template.  If the 
timer is currently running, it will automatically stop recording time for the 
given phase and start the timing of the next phase.  For more information on 
using the timer, see the <a href="#doc27_top">Using the Play/Pause 
button</A> help topic.</P>

<P>Phases marked as complete will show a little checkmark in the completion 
checkbox.  (If you hover the mouse over the checked box, the tooltip will tell
you exactly what date and time the phase was marked complete.)</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/ShowCheckedCompletionButton.png"></center></p>

<P>This example shows the Design phase of a PSP0 project marked as 
complete.</P>

<P>If you need to go back to a previous phase in a given process, you can 
still do so even if the completion checkbox has been pressed. The dashboard 
will still accumulate time in whatever phase you make current.</P>

<h3><a name="para_3_4_1_"></a>3.4.1. Marking a <i>phase</i> complete vs marking the <i>project</i> complete</h3>

<p>By default, a project will be considered complete when all the phases in 
the project have been marked complete. However, if you manually edit the 
project completion date on the plan summary form (either via the input field 
or the checkbox), then you have manually overridden this behavior. From then 
on, the project completion status must be edited manually; it will no longer 
respond to changes in phase completion status. (Actually, you can restore the 
default behavior by typing <code><b>DEFAULT</b></code> in the project 
completion date input field on the plan summary form.)</p>

<h4><a name="para_3_4_1_1_"></a>3.4.1.1. Why should I bother marking the phases/projects complete?</h4>

<P>It is worth remembering that the "To Date" data entries, the data analysis
reports, and the PROBE tool only use data from projects that are marked
complete, so it is good to make a habit of marking your projects complete,
either with the completion checkbox or via the Project Plan Summary form.</p>

<P>Also remember that the task and schedule tool tracks your progress by
looking to see which tasks have been marked complete, so it is good to make a 
habit of marking phases complete. To help you keep track of what has and 
hasn't been marked complete, the hierarchy menus will display a checkmark to 
the right of completed tasks.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/HierarchyMenus4.png"></center></p>


<div></div><a name="doc29_top"></a>

<H2><a name="para_3_5_"></a>3.5. Using the time log editor</H2>

<P>You can use the time log editor to correct mistakes you might make when 
timing your activities.  The time log editor can be opened by selecting the
"Time Log" option on the <a href="#doc32_top">configure menu</a>.</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/TimeLogEditor.png"></center></p>

<h3><a name="para_3_5_1_"></a>3.5.1. Project hierarchy</h3>
<P>The left pane shows the current project hierarchy.  Selecting various 
branches on the hierarchy will limit the time entries displayed to just those 
on the branch chosen.</P>

<P>Next to the name of each hierarchy node, the dashboard displays the total
amount of time that has been logged against that node and all its children.
If you apply a date filter (see below), these times will recalculate based on
the filtered view of the time log.  You can use the "Time Format" pulldown
control to display these times in hours:minutes, decimal hours, or percentages
(of either the total time, or the time logged to the parent of the node).</P>

<a name="doc29_dateFilter"></a><h3><a name="para_3_5_2_"></a>3.5.2. Date filter</h3>
<P>Above the split pane is a set of controls that provide date filtering on 
the time entries display.  Once the desired span of dates has been chosen, 
clicking the "Apply Filter" button will restrict the data shown to the range 
of dates specified.</p>

<P>The Apply Filter button has a pulldown control that provides for several 
common date filters.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/ShowTimeLogFilterPullDown.png"></center></p>

<P>To the left of the "From" entry box and the right of the "To" entry box 
are double arrowed buttons.  These buttons will jump the date filtering 
forward and backward by a unit of time equal to the current filtering date 
range.  For example, if you have filtered the data in the Time Log such that 
only one week of data is showing, pressing these buttons will cause the 
filtering to move backward or forward by one week at a time.</p>

<P>The "From" and "To" entry boxes are places where specific dates can be 
entered.  The format of the date entry depends upon Java localization 
settings, which can be overridden by an entry in the configuration file.</P>

<h3><a name="para_3_5_3_"></a>3.5.3. Time entries</h3>
<P>To change data in the time entries, just pick on the element that you would
like to change.  The elements in the time entries pane are editable.  The
"Logged To" column shows the process phase to which the time was logged.  If
you edit values in this column, you must type the name of a hierarchy phase
exactly;  capitalization, spacing, etc. are all significant.  If you type an
invalid value, the editor will restore the original value. The "Start T"
column shows the start time for the activity.  The "Delta" column shows the
length of time spent in the activity.  The "Int" column shows the amount of
time that the given activity was interrupted.</P>

<h3><a name="para_3_5_4_"></a>3.5.4. Control buttons</h3>
<P>The Add and Delete buttons allow the addition and deletion of time 
entries.  When Add is chosen, by default the last entry in the time log will 
be copied into a new log entry.  You can choose which entry will be copied to 
make the new time entry by picking one of the entries before clicking the Add 
button, or by highlighting the corresponding leaf of the tree.</P>

<P>The Save and Revert buttons will save the changes or revert the entries to 
their previous values.</P>

<a name="doc29_summarize"></a><P>The Summarize button will collapse all time 
entries that were logged to the same process phase into one entry.  The 
Dashboard will create new entries each time that it starts recording time in 
a given process phase (i.e. when a process phase is left and then returned to 
again for more time measurement).  This function will allow you to collaspe 
all duplicates entries in the current display.</P>

<a name="doc29_TimeCardView"></a><p>The Time Card View button will display another 
view of the time data.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/TimeCardView.png"></center></p>

<p>The Time Card View is handy if you work for an employer that makes you 
submit time cards or time sheets.  You can open this window and refer to
the data it contains as you enter data into your employer's time card.</p>

<p>At the top left, a pulldown and a text field allow you to choose the
month and year to display.  On the left side of the window is an
abbreviated version of your hierarchy, containing only the nodes and tasks
where you logged time during the selected month.  Columns are displayed for
the days in the month; tooltips on the column headers display the
corresponding day of the week.  Cells in the table display the amount of
time logged by day and by task.</p>

<p>Two controls in the top center of the window allow you to customize the
display.  You can hide columns for days that contain no time data using the
checkbox, and you can change the display time format using the pulldown.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/ShowTimeCardFormatPullDown.png"></center></p>

<p>You can choose to display time in hours:minutes, decimal hours, or
minutes.</p>


<div></div><a name="doc30_top"></a>

<H2><a name="para_3_6_"></a>3.6. Entering defects</H2>

<P>We all make mistakes.  Dealing with those mistakes in a constructive way 
so that we can learn from them is a lot of what the PSP is all about.</P>

<P>Entering defects in the dashboard is as easy as choosing the defect button.</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/PointToDefectButton.png"></center></p>

<P>When the defect button is chosen, the defect dialog pops up so that you 
can enter information about the defect that you have discovered.</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/EnterDefect.png"></center></p>

<P>In this dialog box, you enter all the data necessary to describe the 
defect.  Each feature of the dialog box is detailed below.</P>

<h3><a name="para_3_6_1_"></a>3.6.1. Defect type</h3>
<P>The defect type pulldown allows you to choose the type of defect.  The 
choices are the same as those given in <I>A Discipline for Software 
Engineering</I>.  At this time, there is no (simple) way to define a different
defect categorization scheme.</P>

<a name="doc30_fixDefects"></a><h3><a name="para_3_6_2_"></a>3.6.2. "fix defects"</h3>
<P>The "Fix Defect" entry is where you can put the ID number of another 
defect if this is a "fix defect".  A fix defect is a defect that was 
injected while fixing another defect.  In order to determine the ID number of 
the other defect, you can pull up the defect editor by choosing "Defect Log"
on the "C" menu.  One of the columns of information about each defect will 
show the ID number.  For more information about using the Defect Log see the 
<a href="#doc31_top">Using the defect log editor</a> help 
topic.</P>

<P>The "new fix defect" button to the right of the ID entry provides another 
way to enter a fix defect.  Consider the following relatively common case.  
You are fixing a bug (so you already have the defect dialog open and it is 
timing your fix).  You edit your code and save the changes.  You compile and 
link to run a test to verify your fix.  Immediately you notice that your fix 
broke something else.  At this point, you can click the new fix defect button 
to get a second defect dialog (to enter this new defect).  This second dialog 
will have the ID number of the previous defect already entered in the ID 
entry blank.  You can now input data relating to this new fix defect. The 
following screenshot shows two defect dialogs open.  The second dialog (the 
one on top) is being used to enter a fix defect.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/QSTwoDefectDialogs.png"></center></p>

<p>This process works with defects that you edit from within the defect log 
editor as well.  See the section below on <a href="#doc30_fixingMultipleDefects">fixing multiple defects</a> for more discussion 
on having two defect dialogs open at once.</P>


<h3><a name="para_3_6_3_"></a>3.6.3. Phase injected and phase removed</h3>
<P>The defect injected and defect removed pulldowns allow selection of the 
phases in which the defect was injected and removed, respectively.  The 
dashboard will set both of these to what it thinks are appropriate choices 
given the current development phase, but that default choice can be 
overridden easily.</P>

<a name="doc30_timing"></a><h3><a name="para_3_6_4_"></a>3.6.4. Timing the defect fix</h3>
<P>The defect dialog has its own built in timer independent of the main 
dashboard timer.  By default, when the dialog first appears, it starts timing 
the fix of the defect.  The fix time display will show the time passing.  The 
intent of this behavior is that most people will discover a defect, push the 
defect button on the dashboard and immediately start fixing the defect.  In 
this scenario, the dialog will immediately start timing the fix.  This 
behavior can be changed via an entry in the configuration file.  Adding the 
following line to the configuration file will cause the dashboard to appear 
without starting the defect timer.</P>

<PRE>defectDialog.autostart=false</PRE>

<P>For more information about the configuration file see the <a href="#doc39_top">configuration file</a> help 
topic.</P>

<P>The timer start/stop button allows starting and stopping of the defect 
timer.  If you stop fixing the given defect but are not finished with the 
fix, you can press this button to stop the timer.</P>

<P>In any case, you can stop the timer and enter a specific time in the fix 
time display box.</P>

<a name="doc30_fixingMultipleDefects"></a><h3><a name="para_3_6_6_"></a>3.6.6. Fixing multiple defects at a time</h3>

<P>If you have the need to fix more than one defect at one time, you can do 
so by simply pushing the defect button on the dashboard again to display 
another defect dialog.  When this happens, the timer on the first dialog will 
stop (if it was running) and the new defect dialog's timer will start 
recording time for the new defect.  This new defect will become the "current"
defect.  When this new defect dialog is dismissed, the most previously opened 
defect dialog will become the current defect.  It will pop to the front and 
its timer will start up again (if it had been running previously).</P>

<P>In this way you can keep an arbitrary number of defect dialogs open at 
once.  If this is to be done, we recommend that you enter a description of 
the defect into the dialog box as soon as it is opened so that when it comes 
back to the front as the currently active defect, it will be clear what you 
were working on.</P>

<P>The left pane shows the current project hierarchy.  Picking various 
branches on the hierarchy will limit the defect entries displayed to just 
those on the branch chosen.</P>

<P>To change data in the defect entries, just pick on the element that you 
would like to change.  When a particular defect entry is picked, the Edit 
button becomes active.  Clicking the Edit button will bring up the same 
dialog box used to enter defects.  All the defect data can be changed using 
this dialog.  For help using the defect entry dialog please see the <a href="#doc30_top">Entering defects</A> help topic.</P>

<P>Just as it is necessary to plan a software project, it is also 
advantageous to learn from the experience of a software project as well.  In 
the PSP course, a lot of postmortem time is spent calculating the various 
metrics and recording them.  The Process Dashboard will take away much of the 
tedium associated with a Postmortem analysis.</p>

<P>For the most part, the work involved in a postmortem for a project that 
uses the Process Dashboard is automated.  The dashboard knows how to fill out 
the Project Plan Summary form with all the derived metrics that are a part of 
the PSP, and it also knows how to create many helpful graphs to let you get a 
visual feel for how the data look.</p>

<p>The main thing that isn't done automatically is the final LOC counts.
You can use the built-in <A HREF="#doc34_top">LOC counter</A>, or an
external LOC counter of your own choosing, to calculate LOC; then enter 
the final counts on the Project Plan Summary form (for PSP levels 0 and 0.1) 
and on the Size Estimating Template (for PSP levels 1 through 3).</p>

<H2><a name="para_4_1_"></a>4.1. Counting LOC</H2>

<p>Measuring size is an important step in the PSP Postmortem phase. If you 
don't pause in your project postmortem to measure the number of added, 
deleted, and modified LOC, you may forever lose the opportunity to capture 
these metrics. It only takes a few moments, and provides you with valuable 
data for future planning efforts.</p>

<P>You may already have a LOC counter that you use on a regular basis. (In 
fact, most people who complete the PSP training course write a LOC counter 
during the training.) If you do need a LOC counter, one is built into the 
dashboard. A link to this LOC counter is included in the Postmortem scripts 
for PSP0.1 and up.</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/PspDiffLink.png"></center></p>

<P>The built-in LOC counter helps to determine the number of physical LOC 
that you have added, deleted, and modified. It also displays a "redlined"
version of the program file, which can be <I>very</I> useful for peer 
reviews.</P>

<P>If you want to measure the size of a newly created file, just leave the 
"Initial File" section blank, and put the newly created file in the "Modified 
File" section.</P>

<P>The LOC counter that is built into the Process Dashboard is extendable to 
allow user defined LOC counting rules.  Methods for writing your own LOC 
counting code that can work with the Process Dashboard will be detailed in 
the <I>Process Authoring Manual</I> when it becomes available on our 
website.</P>


<div></div><a name="doc35_top"></a>

<H2><a name="para_4_2_"></a>4.2. Data charts and reports</H2>
<P>The Process Dashboard automates many reports and charts that can be quite 
useful in a project postmortem.</p>

<h3><a name="para_4_2_1_"></a>4.2.1. The Project Plan Summary</h3>
<P>The main report that contains the most useful postmortem information for 
your project will probably be the Project Plan Summary form.  The Project 
Plan Summary can always be produced by navigating to the project for which 
you would like the report, clicking the drop down list to the right of the
scripts button, and selecting the option for the Project Plan Summary 
form.</p>

<P><center><img src="Images/PointToHierarchyMenusAndScriptsButton.png"></center></p>

<h3><a name="para_4_2_2_"></a>4.2.2. Marking your project complete</h3>
<P>It is important to mark your project as complete.  This lets the dashboard
know that you are finished with the project, and it can use the project data to
calculate the various items in the reports and charts.  You can edit the
project completion date via the appropriate field on the Project Plan Summary.
If you haven't edited the project completion date field on the Project Plan
Summary, marking all the phases in the project complete will mark the project
complete as well.</p>

<P><center><img src="Images/PointToCompletionButton.png"></center></p>

<h3><a name="para_4_2_3_"></a>4.2.3. The Time Log and Defect Log</h3>
<P>HTML versions of the Time Log and the Defect Log are also available from 
the scripts button.  If you navigate to the main Process script for any of 
the PSP processes (usually by following a link marked "top" near the bottom 
of the various reports and forms), you will links named "Time Log" and 
"Defect Log" in the text of the script.  These will bring up a read-only 
version of the two logs.</p>

<a name="doc35_charts"></a><h3><a name="para_4_2_4_"></a>4.2.4. Graphical charts</h3>
<P>The dashboard also makes many graphical charts of various kinds 
available.  Choosing Data Analysis from the C menu will bring up a split view 
that contains an index of various chart types on the left and thumbnails of 
the charts available on the right.  Clicking any of the thumbnail charts will 
bring up a full-sized version of the chart.  When viewing a full-sized chart,
resizing your browser window will cause the chart to resize as well.  Finally,
clicking on a full-sized chart will display a table of the data used to draw
that chart.</p>

<P><center><img src="Images/DataAnalysisScreen.png"></center></p>

<p>The dashboard provides charts that allow</p>

<UL>
 <LI>Defect analysis - rates of injection and removal of defects in the 
   different process phases, defect injection and removal percentages in the 
   different process phases, and pie charts showing the distribution of defect 
   types.</LI>
 <LI>Plan analysis - comparisons of planned time and size with actual planned 
   time and size, planning error of both time and size, and breakdowns of the 
   amount of time spent in the different development phases.</LI>
 <LI>Process analysis - comparisons of productivity rates, defect removal 
   yields, and appraisal to failure cost ratios.</li>
 <LI>Quality analysis - various looks at the quality metrics of defect 
   removal yield, failure and appraisal cost of quality, and LOC reviewed per 
   hour rates.</LI>
 <LI>R3 - the R3 report as called for in a PSP class.</li>
 <LI>R4 - the R4 report as called for in a PSP class.</li>
 <LI>Pareto - shows defects organized by type sorted by number and by fix 
   time.</LI>

<div></div><a name="doc36_top"></a>

<H2><a name="para_4_3_"></a>4.3. Exporting your data</H2>
<P>Presently the dashboard provides two methods of exporting data to other 
applications.</p>

<h3><a name="para_4_3_1_"></a>4.3.1. Creating an ASCII flat file</h3>
<P>You can create an ASCII file of your data by choosing Export from the "C"
menu.  Doing so will bring up the following tool:</p>

<P><center><img src="Images/ExportTool-Data.png"></center></p>

<P><B><EM>NOTE: This tool will be replaced by a much more robust 
import/export capability in a future version of the dashboard and is to be 
considered a deprecated feature.</EM></B></P>

<P>The Export tool presents the project hierarchy in a pane on the left, and 
options to export either your process data or the hierarchy list.  The tool 
also provides a filtering capability via the checkboxes shown to the left of 
each of the nodes in the tree.  Nodes marked with an X will be included in 
the export.</p>

<h4><a name="para_4_3_1_1_"></a>4.3.1.1. Exporting data</h4>
<P>If you choose to export your data, only the process nodes that have 
actually measured data will be written to a file in the following format:</p>

<pre>
/complete/path/to/data/item,&lt;value&gt;
  ...
!Date &amp; Time!,&lt;number of minutes recorded&gt;
  ...
</pre>

<P>The data elements themselves will not be in any particular order, but the 
time data will be in chronological order.  This format was originally 
implemented to allow earned value tracking in an external tool and does not 
really provide a complete dump of the data in the dashboard repository.</p>

<h4><a name="para_4_3_1_2_"></a>4.3.1.2. Exporting the Hierarchy list</h4>
<P>If you choose to export the hierarchy list, the entire hierarchy tree will 
be written to a file.  The file will have the form of one entry per line in 
the following format:</p>

<pre>/complete/path/to/data/item</pre>

<a name="doc36_excel"></a><h3><a name="para_4_3_2_"></a>4.3.2. Exporting data to Excel (PC only)</h3>
<p>Many of the reporting forms in the dashboard have links that say "Export 
to Excel...".  When this link is clicked, an Excel sheet will come up that 
contains the data from that form.</p>

<P>There is a subtle difference between the way that this export is handled 
in Netscape versus the way it is handled in Internet Explorer.</p>

<ul>
 <li><B><A NAME="doc36_static">Static export</A>:</B> In Netscape, the sheet will have static data elements that contain the 
   values of the process variables at the instant that the export was 
   done.</li>
 <li><B>Dynamic export:</B> In Internet Explorer, the sheet will be a linked spreadsheet.  Excel 
   will connect to the dashboard and retrieve the data items.  Excel will 
   typically also display a floating "External data" toolbar, which can be 
   used to refresh the data (as long as the dashboard is still running).  By 
   clicking the "Data Range Properties" button on this floating toolbar, 
   Excel can be configured to refresh the data automatically whenever the 
   spreadsheet is opened.</li>
</ul>

<P>If this feature doesn't seem to be working for you, see the <A HREF="#doc37_BadExcel">related FAQ</A>.

<P>The "Export to Excel..." option will appear on 
<UL>
 <li>forms such as the Project Plan Summary and the Size Estimating
  Template</li>
 <li>tables that are displayed by clicking on a graphical chart (see <a href="#doc35_charts">Data Charts and Reports</a> for
   more information)</li>
 <li>the table that is displayed when you click on the "historical data" link 
   from a PSP1.0 or higher process script</li>
 <li>the HTML time log</li>
 <li>the HTML defect log</li>
 <li>the HTML report that is displayed when you click the
  &quot;Report&quot; button on the <A HREF="#doc22_top">task &amp; schedule tool</A></li>
 <li>the R3 report</li>
 <li>the R4 report</li>

<P><HR><a name="doc37_MacInstall"></a><B>How can I install the Process Dashboard on 
   a Macintosh computer?</b>

<p>At this time, we do not have very much experience with installing or 
running the Dashboard on the Macintosh.  If you are running MacOS X, go ahead 
and try the standard Unix install procedure.</p>

<p>If you have any trouble getting the Dashboard installed and running 
properly on a Mac, <b>please</b> write us an email at 
<em>processdash-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</em>!  We would very much like to 
work with you one-on-one to work things out so that we can document the 
proper procedure.</p>


<P><HR><a name="doc37_NoServer"></a><B>My web browser displays an error message 
   when I try to view a script/form/chart/report/etc.  What is wrong?</B>

<P>The dashboard actually contains a very small HTTP server that provides all
the web content and thus the content cannot be displayed when the dashboard is
not running.  If you get an error message like "The page cannot be displayed -
cannot find server" from Internet Explorer, or "Netscape is unable to locate
the server localhost" from Netscape, check to make certain that the dashboard
is running.</p>

<P>If the dashboard <b>is</b> running, and you have <b>never</b> been able to
 view a script/form/chart/report, it may be that you need to adjust your proxy
 settings.  Many people work at companies where they do not have a direct
 connection to the internet, but instead must connect to the web via an HTTP
 proxy server. If this describes you, you may need to tell your browser to
 bypass the proxy for the address "localhost". The instructions below may not
 apply to your browser word-for-word, but should hopefully get you pointed in
 the right direction:
  <UL>
   <LI>For Internet Explorer, choose &quot;Tools <img src="Images/rarrow.png"> Internet Options&quot;. Click on
      the &quot;Connections&quot; tab, then on the &quot;LAN
      Settings&quot; button. Make certain the &quot;Bypass proxy
      server for local addresses&quot; box is
      <b><strong>checked</strong></b>.</li>
   <LI>For Netscape, choose &quot;Edit <img src="Images/rarrow.png">
      Preferences&quot;. Under the Category &quot;Advanced <img src="Images/rarrow.png"> Proxies&quot;, click the
      &quot;Manual proxy configuration&quot; button, and ensure that
      the &quot;No Proxy for&quot; box contains
      &quot;localhost&quot;.</LI>
  </UL>

<p><hr><a name="doc37_SunPlugin"></a><b>My web browser is able to show the forms, 
but none of the entry blanks have any information.  What is wrong?</b>

<p>If you can see the HTML forms but they don't seem to be talking to the 
Dashboard, you may have a problem with the particular Java Plugin that has 
been installed in your browser.  We know that the Sun Java Plugin when 
running in Internet Explorer under windows has a problem.  To fix that 
problem:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Click on &quot;Start <img src="Images/rarrow.png"> Settings <img src="Images/rarrow.png"> Control Panel <img src="Images/rarrow.png"> Java Plug In&quot;</li>
 <li>Select the &quot;Browser&quot; tab</li>
 <li>Remove the checkmark next to &quot;Microsoft Internet Explorer&quot;</li>
 <li>Choose &quot;Apply&quot;</li>
 <li>You may have to restart IE</li>
</ol>

<p>If you are running on another system / browser and have this problem, 
please send us an email at 
<em>processdash-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</em></p> and we will attempt to 
help you with the problem.

<P><hr><A NAME="doc37_TwoForms"></A><b>If I have a dashboard script or form open,
and I click the script button to open another form, the new form appears in
my existing browser window, replacing the old form. Why can't I have two
forms open at once?</b>

<P>You can have as many scripts and forms open as you like! The behavior
you are seeing is a Microsoft "feature" designed to reduce clutter on your
screen. Fortunately, you can alter that behavior. The instructions below
may not apply to your browser word-for-word, but should hopefully get you
pointed in the right direction:

<OL>
  <LI>In Internet Explorer, choose "Tools <img src="Images/rarrow.png"> Internet Options".</LI>
  <LI>Click the "Advanced" tab.</LI>
  <LI>Remove the checkmark next to the option, "Reuse windows for
      launching shortcuts."</LI>
</OL>

<P><HR><a name="doc37_NoConnection"></a><B>All my data elements say "NO 
CONNECTION".  What is wrong?</B>

<P>The forms always display "live" data - this allows them to auto-recalculate
numbers (like a spreadsheet does) when you edit data.  It also allows changes
made in one browser window to appear immediately in other browser windows. To
make all this happen, the browser maintains an open connection to the
dashboard, and passes data back and forth across this connection.</P>

<P>If you are viewing a form, and you close the main dashboard window, this
open connection is closed as well.  When this occurs, the form immediately
displays "NO CONNECTION" to let you know that your changes are no longer making
it back to the dashboard's data repository. To fix the problem, you must
<OL>
 <LI>restart the dashboard</li>
 <LI>click the refresh/reload button on your browser.</li>
</OL>

<P>If the dashboard <em>is running</em> and you are still getting "NO 
CONNECTION" in the data elements, it could be that the data port that the 
dashboard is trying to use is already taken on your machine.  Normally the 
dashboard will search for an open port to establish the connection, making 
this kind of problem unlikely.  However, if you have overridden this behavior 
in the configuration file the dashboard will not search for a port and may be 
experiencing a conflict with some other process on your machine.  To fix this 
problem, you must</p>
<OL>
 <LI>stop the dashboard</li>
 <LI>remove the following line from your configuration file:
  <pre>
   http.port=&lt;some port number&gt;
  </pre>
 </li>
 <li>restart the dashboard</li>
</ol>

<P>This will allow the dashboard to search for an available communications 
port.</p>

<P><HR><a name="doc37_ERROR"></a><B>Some of my data elements say
"<code>#VALUE!</code>" or "<code>#DIV/0!</code>". What is wrong?</B>

<P>"<code>#VALUE!</code>" indicates that the dashboard cannot calculate a 
value because the formula references a value that is missing (displayed as 
"<CODE>?????</CODE>") or otherwise invalid (for example, a value like 
"<CODE>foo</CODE>" when a number was expected).  When you see 
"<code>#VALUE!</code>" in a dashboard form, it almost <I>always</I> means 
that there is a "<code>?????</code>" field somewhere that you still need to 
fill in. If you fill in all the "<code>?????</code>" fields and the 
"<code>#VALUE!</code>" field does not recalculate, check to ensure that the 
calculation is not <A HREF="#doc23_top">frozen</A>.</P>

<P>"<code>#DIV/0!</code>" indicates that the dashboard encounted a 
divide-by-zero error when calculating a particular data value. Many times 
this is due to having a very small number of usable data points recorded by 
the dashboard.  For instance, if you start the dashboard for the first time 
and try to look at Process Summary forms for a PSP2.1 process, the "% To 
Date" fields will be filled with "<code>#DIV/0!</code>".  This is because the 
total amount of time recorded in the tool is 0.  The percentage calculation 
attempts to divide by zero and returns the error.</P>

<P>Another problem can contribute to this condition as well.  If you are not 
in the habit of clicking the little "completion" checkbox at the right end of 
the dashboard, some (or all) of your data will be ignored by the dashboard 
when creating reports and graphs.  The reporting features of the dashboard

<P><HR><a name="doc37_BadExcel"></a><B>I tried to export my data to Excel with the 
link on one of the forms, but I just got a small ASCII file.  What is 
wrong?</B>

<P>For the "Export to Excel" functionality to work seamlessly, you must have 
the ".IQY" file type properly set up on your system.  This setup is normally 
performed by Microsoft Office during the installation process for Excel
(although, notably, certain releases of Office 97 do not perform this
setup).</p>

<P>If the IQY file type is not properly set up, clicking the "Export to 
Excel" links may instead cause Notepad to appear with a short, three-line 
text file. Alternatively, that three line text file might appear in an Excel 
spreadsheet.</p>

<P>If you encounter such problems, the simplest fix is to add the
following line to your <a href="#doc39_top">configuration file</a>:</p>

<pre> excel.exportMethod=mime</pre>

<p>And data will be exported to Excel <A HREF="#doc36_static">statically</A>.</P>

<P><HR><a name="doc37_NoSubmit"></A><B>Why is there no "submit" button on the HTML 
forms?</B>

<P>The HTML forms used by the dashboard are continually "live".  There is no 
need to press a submit button to send your data to the dashboard.  Simply 
enter your data where necessary, and the dashboard will record it.  However,
after editing a data field, it is usually necessary to leave that field for
your changes to take effect.  You can press the TAB button or click somewhere
else on the page. If the data you are changing is related to other data items 
on the page, you should see the other data elements update. For more
information, see the <A HREF="#doc17_top">Entering process 
data</A> help topic.</P>


<P><HR><a name="doc37_TimerUpdate"></a><B>I've started the timer, but none of the 
numbers on my reports are changing.  How can I know that it is working?</b>

<p>When the timer is running and you first navigate to an activity, the
dashboard will not create an entry in the time log until you have spent a full
minute there; this is by design.  For a more detailed explanation, see the
help topic for the <a href="#doc27_timelogdelay">play /
pause button</a>.</P>

<P>Also, the dashboard will make a quiet "tick" sound whenever the timer 
starts and when a new project or project phase is chosen by the hierarchy 
menus when the timer is running. If you do not hear this sound, check the 
state of the play/pause button.  The current state of the timer can always be 
determined by positioning the mouse pointer over the play/pause button.  A 
tooltip help will pop up containing the current state.</p>


<P><HR><a name="doc37_FrozenData"></a><B>I made a mistake in one of my numbers on 
the Project Plan Summary form, but the form won't let me change the numbers! 
What can I do?</b>

<P>The dashboard will "freeze" your planning data once you have completed the 
planning phase by clicking the completion checkbox.  Also it will freeze all 
the data when the project is marked as complete.  You can make these numbers 
editable by marking either the project or the planning phase incomplete 
again.  For more info on freezing data see the <a href="#doc23_top">data freezing</a> and the <a href="#doc28_top">completion checkbox</a> help 
topics.</p>


<P><HR><a name="doc37_FormsColors"></a><b>What is the significance of the different 
text colors on the PSP process scripts and forms?</b>

<P>In his book <I>A Discipline for Software Engineering</I> where he outlines 
the Personal Software Process, Watts Humphrey introduces the various process 
elements for doing PSP work in a graduated manner.  Each PSP process is built 
upon the previous one.  As a way of showing which process elements were added 
to the previous process definition, the forms in the book highlight the new 
process elements in <b><i>bold italics</i></b>.  These highlighted elements
return to normal text at the next process level. In our attempt to make our
online forms as identical to the PSP forms as possible, we have included that
detail.</P>

<P>However, the Process Dashboard makes certain steps on the scripts and forms
unnecessary (e.g. instructions to sum up various data items -- the dashboard
sums them for you).  These unnecessary process steps are displayed as
greyed-out text.</P>

<P>Also, there are places where the dashboard <i>slightly</i> changes the way
certain steps are performed (e.g.  instead of performing a PROBE calculation,
the PROBE tool should be used).  Green text is used to indicate this slight
departure from the <i>true</i> PSP scripts and forms.</P>

<P><HR><a name="doc37_ExtDocFail"></a><b>I click on a document hyperlink in a 
process script, but the document never opens.</b>

<P>For maximum portability, the document templates provided with the 
dashboard are rich text files (.rtf). Some browsers (most notably Netscape on 
the Linux platform) don't know what to do with a rich text file, and so they 
prompt you to save it (not very helpful). To solve this problem, you must:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Obtain a program capable of editing rich text files, and install it
   on your machine. ("Star Office" is one possibility; it is free and runs 
   on Linux.)</LI>
  <LI>Configure your web browser, and tell it that files ending with ".rtf"
   and/or files of mime type "application/rtf" should be opened with the 
   program you just installed.</LI>
</OL>

<p><hr><a name="doc37_ProcessTweak"></a><b>I'd like to make a minor change in one 
of the process scripts.  Can I do that?</b>

<p>Yes you can!  Please see the section on <a href="#doc41_OverwritingScript">overwriting 
process scripts</a> in the help topic that describes how the dashboard finds 
the script files.</p>

<P><HR><a name="doc37_WhereIsConfig"></A><B>Where is the configuration file located?</B>

<P>The configuration file is named <code>.pspdash</code> on Unix systems and
<code>pspdash.ini</code> on Windows systems.  It can be located in either of
two places: the user's data directory or the user's home directory (on Unix 
systems).  The dashboard looks in the data directory first, then in the user's
home directory.  To find out exactly where your configuration file is located,
choose "About" from the configuration menu, then click on the link for "user
settings". See the <a href="#doc39_top">configuration file</A> help
topic for more information about the configuration file and the settings that
can be defined there.</P>

<P><HR><a name="doc37_WhereData"></a><B>Where is my PSP data stored?</B>
<P>The dashboard stores all of your data in a single directory, in plain text
files.  This directory is often referred to in this documentation as the "data
directory".  With the current default configuration, data is always stored in
the "current working directory" when the dashboard is run.</P>

<P>On Windows systems, the "current working directory" is set by the icon you
use to run the dashboard.  If you right-click on that icon and choose
"Properties", there will be a text field labelled "Start in:" which identifies
your data directory.  Altering this value will change the location where the
dashboard looks for your data.  It is possible to have multiple, independent
data directories all on the same machine; just make copies of the icon you use
to start the dashboard, and give each icon a different value for the "Start in"
directory.</P>

<P>You can find out the exact location of your data directory by
choosing &quot;Help <img src="Images/rarrow.png"> About Process
Dashboard&quot; from the configuration menu, then clicking on the link
for &quot;user settings&quot;.</p>


<P><HR><a name="doc37_MoveData"></A><B>How can I backup my psp data and/or move it 
to another computer?</B>

<P>If you want to backup your psp data, simply back up the contents of your
<a href="#doc37_WhereData">data directory</a>.  To move your psp data to a different
computer,</p>

<UL>
<LI>stop the dashboard if it is running</LI>
<LI>copy the contents of your data directory to a directory on the new
    computer</LI>
<LI>run the dashboard on the new computer, using the chosen directory as the
    data directory.</LI></UL>


<p><hr><a name="doc37_CorruptFiles"></a><b>I got a warning box that claims that my data files have been corrupted!  Can I get my data back?</b>

<p>If you did not continue running the dashboard when the dialog warned you 
that doing so could be quite dangerous, then yes, you probably can.</p>

<p>If you see this message, realize that the dashboard is being overly cautious
with your data.  As long as you didn't plow on ahead and run the dashboard 
with the questionable files in place, no data has been lost yet.  The best 
steps to take next are:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Examine the corrupt files mentioned in the warning message.  If they are 
   of zero length, then there is most likely nothing to worry about. Just 
   delete the zero length files and restart the dashboard.</li>
 <li>If the files contain something, examine their contents.  Removing the 
   "tttt" at the beginning of the filename should indicate what <em>real</em>
   file was being created at the time the problem was detected. See if the 
   temporary files contain any data that is missing from the original file, 
   and copy it over if necessary.  Finally, delete the temporary files and 
   restart the dashboard.</li>
</ol>

<p>Even though the Dashboard has been designed to be safe with your precious 
process data, it is still a good idea to back up the Dashboard's data 
directory every so often.  See the question about <a href="#doc37_MoveData">backing 
up your Dashboard data</a> for more information.</p>


<p><hr><a name="doc37_HideFinished"></a><b>Can I hide my finished projects from the 
hierarchy browser (and other screens)?  They are starting to pile up and are 
taking up a lot of space.</b>

<p>Unfortunately, No.  We have this as a feature request.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the Cut and Paste features in the hierarchy browser will 
allow you to move your completed projects away from the part of the hierarchy 
where you are doing your active development.  You could create a node at the 
top of the project hierarchy called "Archived Projects" and Cut and Paste 
your finished projects as children under it.  They would still count towards 
your PROBE Estimates and your Planning data.  See the <a href="#doc18_top">hierarchy editor</a> help topic
for more information.</p>


<p><hr><a name="doc37_OutlierProject"></a><b>I have a project in my hierarchy that 
doesn't have much to do with my current development habits.  Can I mark it as 
an "outlier" so that it doesn't corrupt the Planning and PROBE estimates?</b>

<p>There are basically two concerns when in this kind of situation.</p>
<ol>
 <li>Removing the project from PROBE Estimates</li>
 <li>Removing the project from Planning and To Date calculations</li>
</ol>

<p>The most important time to identify a project as an outlier is during 
PROBE-style linear regression.  This is easy to do; when using the PROBE 
tool, you can click on the "Chart" button to visually identify outliers, 
and the "Filter" button to remove any outliers from the regression 
calculation.  The PROBE Wizard will also let you remove various data pairings 
from the regression calculation, but it won't show you a graph and thus isn't 
as intuitive.  See the <a href="#doc21_top">PROBE 
Tool</a> and <a href="#doc20_top">PROBE Wizard</a>
help topics for more information.</p>

<p>To remove a project's effects from Planning and To Date calculations, you 
can make use of multiple data sets.  By defining a customized data set for 
your current project, you can isolate only the data you know is applicable.  
See the <a href="#doc40_top">multiple To Date 
data</a> help topic for more information.</p>

<p>A less desireable but simpler way to remove a project's effects would be 
to mark the project as incomplete.  The To Date, Planning, and PROBE 
calculations only use completed projects for their data sets.  The drawback 
with this approach is that you will lose the accurate completion date for the 
project that you mark incomplete.</p>

<P><HR><a name="doc37_DCRSCR"></a><b>What happened to the DCR and SCR processes?</b>

<P>The DCR and SCR processes were shipped with version 1.1 of the
Process Dashboard.  They were later removed from the main dashboard
and distributed as add-on process sets.  As of version 1.4.1, they are
no longer available.</P>

<P>Explicit written permission from Addison-Wesley is required to modify
PSP scripts or distribute modified PSP scripts.  Since the DCR/SCR process
scripts were derived from the copyrighted PSP process scripts in <i>A
Discipline for Software Engineering</i>, they fall into this category.
We have not attempted to obtain that permission from Addison-Wesley, so
these processes are no longer available.</p>

<P><HR><a name="doc37_Auto"></a><B>I would like to integrate the dashboard more 
closely with my IDE. Is it possible to programatically start/stop the timer, 
and change the active hierarchy path?</B>

<P>Yes! If you issue an HTTP request of the form:

<PRE><FONT SIZE="-2">http://localhost:2468/control/startTiming.class</FONT></PRE>

the dashboard timer will start.  Similarly, an HTTP request of the form:

<PRE><FONT SIZE="-2">http://localhost:2468/control/stopTiming.class</FONT></PRE>

will pause the timer. And

<PRE><FONT SIZE="-2">http://localhost:2468/Non+Project/foo//control/setPath.class</FONT></PRE>

will change the current hierarchy path to "/Non Project/foo". If you want
to change the current hierarchy path <b>and</b> start the timer, use

<PRE><FONT SIZE="-2">...//control/setPath.class<B>?start</B></FONT></PRE>

<B>Note</B>: these commands will have no effect unless the HTTP
request originates from the same machine where the dashboard is
running.

 <li><a name="doc39_autoRealization"></a><strong>autoRealization</strong><br>
   Policy for auto-realization of data. To save time and memory, formulas are 
   not immediately calculated when the dashboard opens.  Instead, they are 
   calculated (realized) at some later time.  This realization always occurs 
   automatically when their value must be displayed for the first time on a 
   chart, form, or report.  In addition, a background process runs when the 
   the dashboard starts, and slowly calculates formulas.  If this setting has 
   the value "full", all data will be automatically realized by this 
   background process.  If this setting has the value "min", only global 
   (e.g. "To Date") data is auto-realized. If this setting has the value 
   "none", no data will be auto-realized.  If you are on a slow computer, and 
   you notice irritating delays the first time you view a chart, form, or 
   report, try using the "full" option.  If you experience irritating delays 
   when saving edits to the hierarchy, try using the "min" or "none" options.<br>

<div></div><a name="doc40_top"></a>

<H2><a name="para_6_2_"></a>6.2. Using Multiple "To Date" Data Sets</H2>

<P>By default, the dashboard maintains one set of To Date data, which rolls 
up data from all of your completed PSP projects. This may not meet your data 
needs. For example, if you continually work in several different programming 
languages, you might want multiple, independent sets of To Date data, one 
for each programming language.  "Data Rollup Templates" address this need.</P>

<p>Data Rollup Templates allow filtering of the data that appears on process 
forms such as the Project Plan Summary.  Once you have created a data rollup 
in your hierarchy, you can choose to view the forms based on all of your PSP 
related data or just on the subset that you have defined.  The Data Rollup 
Templates can also be used to rollup data from many small PSP-sized tasks up 
to the project level. It's just a matter of how you define the data rollup 
filter expression.</P>

<H3><a name="para_6_2_1_"></a>6.2.1. Creating Multiple "To Date" Data Sets</H3>

<p>Extra To Date data sets are created in much the same way you would 
create a new project.  You just create the data set in the hierarchy as if 
you are adding a Project Template.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/HierarchyEditorRollup.png"></center></p>

<p>You can rename the data set node just like you can a project.  Also, the 
location of the data set itself in the hierarchy is not important.  Just 
place it wherever it seems to fit best to you.  For more information on 
adding nodes and templates and on using the hierarchy editor in general, see 
the <a href="#doc18_top">hierarchy editor</a> help 
topic.</p>

<p>Note - there is always a default rollup, defined automatically by the 
dashboard, which is called "/To Date/PSP/All".  This rollup will not appear 
in your hierarchy, but its data is available for use by projects in your 
hierarchy.</p>

<a name="doc40_filter"></a><H3><a name="para_6_2_2_"></a>6.2.2. Customizing "To Date" Data Sets</H3>

<p>When you first create a new To Date data set, it will (by default) be 
rolling up data from all completed PSP projects.  Therefore, the first thing 
you'll probably want to do is customize the filter which is used to generate 
the list of projects that it will roll up data from.  This is done via data 
entered in an HTML form, much like the standard process forms.</p>

<p>To access the filtering form, use the hierarchy menus to navigate to the 
To Date data set you have just created.  Once there, click the drop-down 
button on the script button and choose "Edit Data Rollup Filter."</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/ChooseEditDataRollupFilter.png"></center></p>

<p>The filter form will appear that will let you edit the expression that is 
used to filter the project list that is used in the data rollup.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/DataRollupFilterForm.png"></center></p>

<p>Some common filtering criteria are displayed as choices on the form:
<ul>
 <li>Only rollup projects completed after a certain date</li>
 <li>Only rollup projects written with a certain language</li>
 <li>Only rollup projects with certain keywords</li>
 <li>Only rollup projects whose hierarchy path starts with a certain 
   string</li>
</ul>

<p>You can check the appropriate boxes, and edit the details for each 
criteria.  When you're done, click the "Filter!" button. This button will 
compute the corresponding filter expression, and put it in the box below.  
This will also cause the "list of included projects" to recalculate, showing 
you all the projects in your hierarchy that meet the criteria.</p>

<p>If you feel comfortable with the data expression syntax, you can edit the 
filter expression directly.  After you make changes to the expression, you'll 
have to move the cursor out of the text area (by hitting TAB or by clicking 
somewhere on the HTML page background) for the included project list to 
recalculate.</p>

<p><B>TIP:</B> If the included project list is empty and you don't think it 
should be, you may have a syntax error in your filter expression.  A syntax 
error in your expression will essentially be treated the same as the 
expression "false".  Note, however, that an empty included project list does 
not automatically mean your filter expression syntax is bad - it may be a 
valid expression, and there just might not be any projects that meet the 
criteria.</p>

<H3><a name="para_6_2_3_"></a>6.2.3. Viewing Rolled Up Data</H3>

<P>To view rolled up data, just use the hierarchy menus to navigate to a data 
rollup node, and click the script button. The <A HREF="#doc35_charts">Data 
Analysis</A> center will appear - but it will be displaying only data from 
the projects that you have included in your rollup!  In fact, the main "Data 
Analysis" center which is launched from the Configure menu is nothing more 
than a view of the rolled up data for the automatic data rollup called "/To 
Date/PSP/All".</P>

<H3><a name="para_6_2_4_"></a>6.2.4. Using Alternate "To Date" Data Sets</H3>

<p>Once you have created an additional data rollup set, you will notice that 
all of your PSP Project Plan Summaries will contain an extra drop-down list.  
This drop down list is located in the "Project Settings" section of the plan 
summary form.  The drop-down list is labeled "Base 'To Date' PSP data on:", 
and the drop down list will contain all the PSP data rollup objects you have 
defined, plus the extra "default" rollup, which is called "/To 
Date/PSP/All".  Choosing a different rollup from this list will cause this 
project to use that rollup as the basis for data in the "Plan" and "To Date"
columns.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/DataRollupSummaryPullDown.png"></center></p>

<p><B>TIP:</B> remember that data in the plan column <A HREF="#doc23_top">freezes</A> when planning is marked 
complete, and data in the "To Date" columns freezes when the project is 
marked complete.  Therefore, if Planning and/or the entire project is marked 
complete when you alter the drop-down, the data in the "Plan" and/or "To 
Date" columns will not recalculate.</p>

<a name="doc41_OverwritingScript"></a><h2><a name="para_6_3_"></a>6.3. Making a change to a script</h2>

<p>Perhaps the built-in PSP processes suit you well, but you'd like to make 
some small tweak to one of the HTML scripts.  For example, you might like to 
add company specific instructions to some of the steps (to run a code 
analyzer perhaps).</p>

<p>When you're viewing the page in question, you notice it has the URL:</p>

<p><code>http://localhost:2468/Project+Path//<b>psp2.1/develop.htm</b></code></p>

<p>This example uses the PSP2.1 process - other processes will have other text in place of "psp2.1".</p>

<p>Take the following steps:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Find your pspdash.jar file (if you are running on Windows, it should be 
   specified in the shortcut that launches the dashboard -- if you are 
   running on Unix, you should know where the pspdash.jar is located based on 
   where you installed the dashboard!).</li>
 <li>Create a directory alongside it called "Templates".</li>
 <li>Create a subdirectory within "Templates" called "psp2.1".</li>
 <li>Save the current version of the HTML file to the psp2.1 subdirectory. 
   This can be done by choosing &quot;File
   <img src="Images/rarrow.png">
   Save As...&quot; from within your web browser.</li>
 <li>Edit it to your heart's content using the HTML editor of your choice.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, every time you visit that page, for any applicable project in your 
hierarchy, the dashboard will show you the page containing your custom 
changes.</p>

<a name="doc41_FindFiles"></a><H2><a name="para_6_4_"></a>6.4. How the Dashboard finds process files</H2>

<p>When it starts, the dashboard searches for process files and add-ins and 
dynamically loads them.  Also, every time you request a web page from 
<code>http://localhost:2468/</code>, the dashboard is using this same search 
mechanism.</p>

<p>The dashboard searches for files in the following locations, in the 
following order:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Look first in the directory specified by the user setting 
   "templates.directory" (should end in "Templates").</li>

 <li>Next, look in any JAR files contained in that directory.</li>

 <li>Next, look in any JAR files contained in the parent of that 
   directory.</li>

 <li>If there is a Templates directory alongside the pspdash.jar file, look 
   there, first for the file, then for JARs containing the file.</li>

 <li>If there are any JAR files next to the pspdash.jar file, look in 
   them.</li>

 <li>Finally, look in the classpath (which includes the pspdash.jar file, and 
   contains all the built-in processes).</li>
</ol>

<p>When looking for a particular file, the dashboard will search in the above 
locations and stop as soon as it finds a matching file. This means that if 
you want to customize anything that appears in a process templates directory, 
you can.  Just create your custom version and put it in a location earlier on 
the search list.</p>

<a name="doc41_sharing"></a><h3><a name="para_6_4_1_"></a>6.4.1. Sharing changes with team members</h3>

<p>If you're working with a team, and everyone on your team would like access 
to changes you have made to a process script, you can do the following:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Create a directory somewhere out on a shared network drive, called 
   "Templates" (for example: "<code>T:\Common\Our Team 
   Folder\Templates</code>" on a Windows network, or 
   "<code>/usr/shared/OurTeam/Templates</code>" on a Unix network)</li>
 <li>Have each person on your team edit their configuration file, and add a 
   line for the "templates.directory" setting. (for example: 
   "<code>templates.directory=T:\\Common\\Our Team Folder\\Templates</code>"
   - the double backslashes are required on Windows systems; Unix systems can 
   just use single forward slashes).</li>
 <li>Put custom versions of files underneath this team templates directory.  
   For example, you could put:
  <ul>
   <li>HTML files overriding files that are built into the dashboard</li>
   <li>LanguageFilters defining custom LOC counters</li>
   <li><a href="#doc42_XmlDef">template.xml</a> files 
      defining team processes</li>
   <li>Data files and HTML scripts/forms supporting those team <a href="#doc42_top">processes</a></li>
  </ul>
   and when you make changes to these items, everyone on the team will see 
   them automatically (except as noted below).</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="para_6_4_2_"></a>6.4.2. Some files are only read at start up</h3>

<p>When you change HTML files, everyone will see your changes immediately.  
The very next time they view the HTML page in question, they will see your 
changes.  Other files, however, the dashboard will only read once.  For 
example, template.xml files, datafiles, and LOC counters will only be read 
once, when the dashboard starts up.  If you make changes to these files, 
people will have to shut down and restart their dashboard to see your 
changes.</p>

<!-- How to define your own custom process
   * An overview of the process definition architecture: explain the three
     pieces to the puzzle and how they fit together:
      * "-template.xml" files define the *structure* of the process
      * optional HTML files provide process scripts and forms
      * optional data files define custom calculations for your process
     Also explain how the dashboard locates these files (i.e., where should
     you put these files, and how can you share them with your co-workers) -->


<P>The dashboard has been designed from the ground up to support custom 
processes.  The PSP scripts and forms that you see are not hard-coded into 
the tool. Instead, they are dynamically loaded from simple HTML and text 
files.  Thus, it is possible to create your own custom process scripts, 
forms, and data that will be dynamically integrated into the dashboard.</P>

<P>The dashboard process definition framework provides a great deal of 
flexibility and power for process automation. The more advanced features will 
be documented in a <I>Process Authoring Manual</I>, which will be available 
for download from <U>http://processdash.sourceforge.net/</U> soon. However, 
creating a simple, custom process is not difficult. Just follow these 
steps:</P>

</OL>

<H3><a name="para_6_5_1_"></a>6.5.1. <A NAME="doc42_ProcessStructure">Step 1: Identify your process structure</A></H3>

<P>What steps do you want to include in your process? The standard PSP0 
process, of course, includes the phases Planning, Design, Code, Compile, 
Test, and Postmortem. Think through your process and decide upon the list of 
phases that your process will include.</P>

<P>Think this through carefully. Remember how you had to restart your "To 
Date" data when you graduated from PSP1.1 to PSP2? The same truth applies 
here. Once you have defined a custom process and used it in the dashboard, 
even slight changes to the process definition will invalidate all your 
historical data. In fact, once you create a process definition and use it to 
perform a project, you can no longer even change the names of the phases 
without losing historical data.</P>

<P>If your process definition is still immature and evolving, it is probably 
better to use the <A HREF="#doc2_generic">Generic process</A> for a 
while. As you begin creating your own custom process definitions, the 
flexibility of the generic process will allow you to radically change your 
process from one task to the next in response to process improvement 
proposals.  Once you decide upon and finalize the <u>list of phases</u> in 
your process, you are ready to begin using a custom process.</P>

<P>Some guidelines to consider as you identify your process phases:</P>

<P><B>Don't subdivide things too far.</B> Take a look at the PSP processes, 
for example. They will define a single phase like Planning, even though it 
contains several different steps (obtain requirements, make size estimate, 
make resource estimate, create schedule, etc.). The PSP process definition 
does not break each of these steps into its own phase! Herein lies the 
difference between a <B>phase</B> and an <B>activity</B>. By carefully 
defining the high level phases in the process, Watts Humphrey was free to 
incorporate process improvements simply by altering the set of activities in 
each phase. Remember also that when you enact your process, you will have to 
collect time and defect data with phase-level granularity. If you break your 
process up into a zillion tasks that each take only a minute, you will go 
crazy just trying to log time accurately.</P>

<P><B>Choose abbreviations for long phase names.</B> When you write your 
process script, you may have phases with verbose names like "High Level 
Design Review". Realize that if you use this long phase name, the main 
dashboard window is going to stretch halfway across your screen whenever you 
navigate to that phase. An abbreviation like "HLD Review" may be more 
appropriate. You can still refer to the phase by its unabbreviated name when 
you create your HTML process scripts and forms.</P>

<P><B>Include Planning and Postmortem phases.</B> In his book, Watts Humphrey
encourages you to always include these phases in any process you define.  The 
planning phase serves an obvious purpose of estimating size, cost, schedule, 
risk, etc. The postmortem phase allows you to ensure accurate collection of 
data and capture process improvement proposals.</P>

<H3><a name="para_6_5_2_"></a>6.5.2. <A NAME="doc42_XmlDef">Step 2: Create an XML definition for your process</A></H3>

<P>The dashboard understands a process structure that is described in XML 
format. <B>The discussion below assumes that you are familiar with XML.</B>
If this is not the case, please go read a nice tutorial on XML before 
proceeding!!</P>

<P>Here is an example of an XML description file for a PSP0 process:</P>

<P>A process definition begins with the <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> tag and

If you will be collecting defects with your process, you should include the 
"<CODE>defectLog</CODE>" attribute as shown above (and remember that XML is 
case-sensitive, so "<CODE>defect<U>l</U>og</CODE>" will not work).</P>

<P>Between the <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> tags, list the phases in order. 
Each phase is described with a <code>&lt;phase&gt;</code> tag. The phase tag 
must have a "<code>name</code>" attribute, and all of the phase names must be 
<B>unique</B>. As was true of template names, phase names cannot contain the 
"/" character. The phase type can optionally be specified with the 
"<CODE>type</CODE>" attribute. The following is a list of valid types that 
can be specified.  Their full explanation is not detailed here, but will be 
in the <I>Process Authoring Manual</I> coming soon on our website.</p>


<UL>

<P>Phase types are not required. Even if you specify the phase type for one 
phase, you can omit it for others. If you do specify phase types, the 
dashboard will be able to intelligently calculate metrics like Yield, A/FR, 
and Defect removal efficiency.</P>

<H3><a name="para_6_5_3_"></a>6.5.3. <A NAME="doc42_XmlDesc">Step 3: Save your XML process descriptor</A></H3>

<P>Once your XML process descriptor is complete, it is time to save it 
somewhere <A HREF="#doc41_FindFiles">where the dashboard 
can find it</A>. Follow these steps:</P>

<ol>
 <li>Find your pspdash.jar file (on Windows machines, it is probably located 
   in <U>C:\Program Files\Process Dashboard</U>).</li>
 <li>Create a directory alongside it called "Templates" (e.g., <U>C:\Program 
   Files\Process Dashboard\Templates</U>).</li>
 <li>Save your XML process descriptor in that Templates directory. 
   <B>Important:</B> you must give your XML process descriptor a filename 
   ending with "<code><b>-template.xml</b></code>" to signal to the dashboard 
   that this is an XML process template descriptor.  If you do not choose a 
   filename ending with "<code><b>-template.xml</b></code>", your process 
   descriptor will be ignored.</li>
</ol>

<P>This is the simplest place to put your XML process descriptor. Of course, 
if you want to share your process with team members, you may want to put it 
somewhere else. See the section on <A HREF="#doc41_FindFiles">how the dashboard finds process 
files</A> for more information. Keep in mind that the dashboard will search 
for "<code><b>-template.xml</b></code>" files in the "Templates" directories 
only - subdirectories will not be searched.</P>

<H3><a name="para_6_5_4_"></a>6.5.4. <A NAME="doc42_Restart">Step 4: Restart the dashboard</A></H3>

<P>Once your XML process descriptor is in place, it is necessary to shut down 
the dashboard and restart it for the new process to be found.  Once found, 
you will automatically have:</P>

<UL>
 <LI>A template on the hierarchy editor's "Add Template" menu for your 
   process</LI>
 <LI>A template on the hierarchy editor's "Add Template" menu for <B>rolling 
   up</B> data from your process</LI>
 <LI>A custom project plan summary form for your process</LI>
</UL>

<P>That should be enough to get you started! For more advanced topics like</P>

<UL>
 <LI>Defining HTML scripts for the phases of your process</LI>
 <LI>Defining custom forms</LI>
 <LI>Generating charts and tables of your data</LI>
 <LI>Defining custom calculations (or altering the existing calculations) for 
   the data in your process</LI>
 <LI>Creating custom defect type standards</LI>
 <LI>Integrating external documents into process scripts</LI>
 <LI>Writing custom language filters for the LOC counter</LI>
