Errors.Lost_Lock.Title=Network Connectivity Problems
Errors.Lost_Lock.Message=\
    Although you opened the work breakdown structure in read-write\n\
    mode, your connection to the network was broken, and your lock\n\
    on the WBS was lost.  In the meantime, another individual has\n\
    opened the work breakdown structure for editing, so your lock\n\
    could not be reclaimed.\n\
    \ \n\
    As a result, you will no longer be able to save changes to the\n\
    work breakdown structure.  You are strongly encouraged to close\n\
    and reopen the work breakdown structure editor.

    To avoid losing your changes, you may wish to choose "Save a Copy"\n\
    from the "File" menu.

    The Work Breakdown Structure Editor stores data for this project\n\
    into XML files located at:\n\
    \        {0}\n\
    \ \n\
    The WBS Editor attempted to lock those files for writing, but the\n\

    unusual situation, possibly caused by the current configuration of\n\
    the remote network directory.

    You have requested to replace the planned data in this Work Breakdown\n\

    A "replace data" operation is appropriate in some scenarios:\n\
    \ \n\
    \ \u2022 If network connectivity problems prevented you from saving\n\
    \    changes in the past; you saved your changes into a WBS data\n\
    \    zip file; you now wish to load those edits back into the team\n\
    \    plan; and no one else has edited the team plan in the meantime\n\
    \ \n\
    \ \u2022 If your team has created several alternative plans during\n\
    \    a team project launch, and you wish to make one of those\n\
    \    alternatives the official plan before the project begins\n\
    \ \n\
    \ \u2022 If you saved a WBS data file to work with it offline, you\n\
    \    wish to apply your offline changes, and no one else has altered\n\
    \    the real project WBS in the meantime\n\
    \ \n\
    When you perform a "replace data" operation, all of the data in the\n\
    current plan will be discarded and replaced with the data from the\n\
    file you specify.  Please ensure that this is your intent.\n\

    from a WBS data ZIP file?
