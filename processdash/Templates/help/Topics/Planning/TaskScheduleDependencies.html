<h1>Tracking Task Dependencies</h1>

<p>Creating a schedule with the <a href="UsingTaskSchedule.html">Task and
Schedule</a> tool, and tracking your progress with earned value, is an
excellent way to stay on track and deliver your work on time.  But when you
are working as part of a team, it is also important to coordinate with your
team members.  This is especially true if your team member needs to use
something that you are producing (or vice versa).  To facilitate this type of
coordination, the dashboard will allow you to define and track task
dependencies.  <i><b>Note:</b> if you are not working as a member of a team,
you probably don't need to declare task dependencies.</i></p>

<p>Task dependencies are a way of stating, &quot;<i>this</i> task cannot start
until <i>those</i> tasks are finished.&quot; You can define dependencies
between tasks that appear in earned value schedules.  Once defined, the
dashboard will help you to track the status of these dependencies, as
described below. However, the presence of dependencies does not currently
alter the earned value calculations in any way.  In particular, <b>the
dashboard does not use these dependencies to perform any sort of critical path
analysis</b>.  If you use "Flat View" to specify task order, the dashboard
does not prevent you from reordering tasks before their predecessors.  These
capabilities may be added in the future.  But at the current time, task
dependencies are simply a way of showing you the information you need in order
to coordinate with your teammates more effectively.</p>

<p>There are two different ways you can define task dependencies:<ul>

<li>When your team is planning a team project, you can define dependencies
in the Work Breakdown Struture Editor.</li>

<li>When you view an earned value schedule in the
<a href="UsingTaskSchedule.html">Task and Schedule</a> window, you can
define dependencies by double-clicking on a cell in the "Dep" column.</li></ul>

Most teams will use the first approach almost exclusively.</p>

<p>Once you've defined a task dependency, the dashboard will display icons to
indicate the presence and status of dependent tasks.  If a task has a
dependency, one of the following icons will be displayed:</p>


<table style="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm">

<tr><td nowrap><b style="color:red">???</a></td>
    <td>This depends on at least one other task, but status information
        for that task is not available.</td></tr>

<tr><td><img src="../../../Images/stop.gif"></td>
    <td>This depends on at least one other task that still has not been
        completed.</td></tr>

<tr><td><img src="../../../Images/check.gif"></td>
    <td>All of the dependencies for this task have been completed.</td></tr>

<tr><td><img src="../../../Images/group.gif"></td>
    <td>Other people are waiting for you to complete this task.</td></tr>

</table>


<p>These icons are displayed in the "Dep" column of the task list when it
appears in the Task and Schedule window, the earned value report, or the
earned value weekly view.  In addition, the icon will be displayed on the main
dashboard window when you select a task that has a related dependency:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../../Images/MainWindowDependencyIndicator.png"></p>

<p>You can place your mouse over these icons for detailed status information.
(When you see a dependency icon in your web browser, you'll need to click as
well.)  The detailed status will show you all the dependent tasks (if there is
more than one), the completion status of each, the names of the individuals
assigned to the task, the planned completion date, and the task's percentage
complete.</p>
