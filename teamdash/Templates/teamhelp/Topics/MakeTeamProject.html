<h1>Create a Team Project (Team Leader)</h1>

<p>Creating a team project is simple. Just follow these steps:</p>

<ol>

 <li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>Start the Team Dashboard using the
     appropriately named shortcut on the team leader's computer. The
     Team Dashboard will open.</li>

 <li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>In the Team Dashboard window, click the File
     menu and choose "New Project."</li>

 <li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>The Team Project Setup Wizard will appear in
     your web browser to walk you through the steps involved in creating a
     team project. Read each page carefully and supply the information
     requested. One page of the wizard will ask whether you wish to create a
     team project or a master project; choose the Team Project option.</li>

 <li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>At one point, the Team Project Setup Wizard will
     give you an opportunity to select the directory where you would like to
     store data for this team project.  By default, it will encourage you to
     store data into the <a href="TeamConfigDir.html">team configuration
     directory</a>.  Most teams are <b>strongly</b> encouraged to keep this
     default, as it is simpler and less confusing to keep all your data in one
     place.  If you have a compelling need to place <i>team project</i> data in
     a separate location than <i>configuration</i> data, you can alter this
     path.  However, the directory you choose <b><u>must meet</u></b> all of
     the same <a href="TeamConfigDir.html#criteria">accessibility and
     permissions criteria</a> as the team configuration directory.</li>

 <li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>When the wizard finishes, you can close
     the browser window.</li>

</ol>
