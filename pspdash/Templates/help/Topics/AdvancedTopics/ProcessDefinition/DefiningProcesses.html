<H1>Defining your own processes for use in the Process Dashboard</H1>


<!-- How to define your own custom process
   * An overview of the process definition architecture: explain the three
     pieces to the puzzle and how they fit together:
      * "-template.xml" files define the *structure* of the process
      * optional HTML files provide process scripts and forms
      * optional data files define custom calculations for your process
     Also explain how the dashboard locates these files (i.e., where should
     you put these files, and how can you share them with your co-workers) -->


<P>The dashboard has been designed from the ground up to support custom 
processes.  The PSP scripts and forms that you see are not hard-coded into 
the tool. Instead, they are dynamically loaded from simple HTML and text 
files.  Thus, it is possible to create your own custom process scripts, 
forms, and data that will be dynamically integrated into the dashboard.</P>

<P>The dashboard process definition framework provides a great deal of 
flexibility and power for process automation. The more advanced features will 
be documented in a <I>Process Authoring Manual</I>, which will be available 
for download from <U>http://processdash.sourceforge.net/</U> soon. However, 
creating a simple, custom process is not difficult. Just follow these 
steps:</P>

<H2><A NAME="ProcessStructure">Step 1: Identify your process structure</A></H2>

<P>What steps do you want to include in your process? The standard PSP0 
process, of course, includes the phases Planning, Design, Code, Compile, 
Test, and Postmortem. Think through your process and decide upon the list of 
phases that your process will include.</P>

<P>Think this through carefully. Remember how you had to restart your "To 
Date" data when you graduated from PSP1.1 to PSP2? The same truth applies 
here. Once you have defined a custom process and used it in the dashboard, 
even slight changes to the process definition will invalidate all your 
historical data. In fact, once you create a process definition and use it to 
perform a project, you can no longer even change the names of the phases 
without losing historical data.</P>

<P>If your process definition is still immature and evolving, it is probably 
better to use the <A 
HREF="../../Overview/ProcessScripts.html#generic">Generic process</A> for a 
while. As you begin creating your own custom process definitions, the 
flexibility of the generic process will allow you to radically change your 
process from one task to the next in response to process improvement 
proposals.  Once you decide upon and finalize the <u>list of phases</u> in 
your process, you are ready to begin using a custom process.</P>

<P>Some guidelines to consider as you identify your process phases:</P>

<P><B>Don't subdivide things too far.</B> Take a look at the PSP processes, 
for example. They will define a single phase like Planning, even though it 
contains several different steps (obtain requirements, make size estimate, 
make resource estimate, create schedule, etc.). The PSP process definition 
does not break each of these steps into its own phase! Herein lies the 
difference between a <B>phase</B> and an <B>activity</B>. By carefully 
defining the high level phases in the process, Watts Humphrey was free to 
incorporate process improvements simply by altering the set of activities in 
each phase. Remember also that when you enact your process, you will have to 
collect time and defect data with phase-level granularity. If you break your 
process up into a zillion tasks that each take only a minute, you will go 
crazy just trying to log time accurately.</P>

<P><B>Choose abbreviations for long phase names.</B> When you write your 
process script, you may have phases with verbose names like "High Level 
Design Review". Realize that if you use this long phase name, the main 
dashboard window is going to stretch halfway across your screen whenever you 
navigate to that phase. An abbreviation like "HLD Review" may be more 
appropriate. You can still refer to the phase by its unabbreviated name when 
you create your HTML process scripts and forms.</P>

<P><B>Include Planning and Postmortem phases.</B> In his book, Watts Humphrey
encourages you to always include these phases in any process you define.  The 
planning phase serves an obvious purpose of estimating size, cost, schedule, 
risk, etc. The postmortem phase allows you to ensure accurate collection of 
data and capture process improvement proposals.</P> 

<H2><A NAME="XmlDef">Step 2: Create an XML definition for your process</A></H2>

<P>The dashboard understands a process structure that is described in XML 
format. <B>The discussion below assumes that you are familiar with XML.</B> 
If this is not the case, please go read a nice tutorial on XML before 
proceeding!!</P> 

<P>Here is an example of an XML description file for a PSP0 process:</P>
<TABLE BORDER="1" WIDTH="100%">
 <TR>
  <TD WIDTH="100%">
   <PRE>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">&lt;?xml version='1.0'?&gt;

&lt;dashboard-process-template&gt;</FONT>
   &lt;template name="PSP0" defectLog="true"&gt;
      &lt;phase name="Planning"   type="plan"/&gt;
      &lt;phase name="Design"     type="dld"/&gt;
      &lt;phase name="Code"       type="code"/&gt;
      &lt;phase name="Compile"    type="comp"/&gt;
      &lt;phase name="Test"       type="ut"/&gt;
      &lt;phase name="Postmortem" type="pm"/&gt;
   &lt;/template&gt;
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">&lt;/dashboard-process-template&gt;</FONT>
   </PRE>
  </TD>
 </TR>
</TABLE>

<P>The file begins and ends with the header and footer (which appear in blue 
above). Between the header and footer, any number of process templates can be 
defined. (The file above only defines one process template.)</P>

<P>A process definition begins with the <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> tag and 
ends with <code>&lt;/template&gt;</code>. The template tag must have a 
"<code>name</code>" attribute, and all of the processes you define must have 
<B>unique</B> names. Also, template names cannot contain the "/" character. 
If you will be collecting defects with your process, you should include the 
"<CODE>defectLog</CODE>" attribute as shown above (and remember that XML is 
case-sensitive, so "<CODE>defect<U>l</U>og</CODE>" will not work).</P>

<P>Between the <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> tags, list the phases in order. 
Each phase is described with a <code>&lt;phase&gt;</code> tag. The phase tag 
must have a "<code>name</code>" attribute, and all of the phase names must be 
<B>unique</B>. As was true of template names, phase names cannot contain the 
"/" character. The phase type can optionally be specified with the 
"<CODE>type</CODE>" attribute. The following is a list of valid types that 
can be specified.  Their full explanation is not detailed here, but will be 
in the <I>Process Authoring Manual</I> coming soon on our website.</p>


<UL>
 <LI><B>Appraisal phase types:</B> <tt>appraisal reqinsp hldr hldrinsp dldr 
   dldinsp cr codeinsp</tt></LI>
 <LI><B>Failure phase types:</B> <tt>failure comp ut it st at pl</tt></LI>
 <LI><B>Overhead phase types:</B> <tt>mgmt strat plan pm</tt></LI>
 <LI><B>Development phase types:</B> <tt>req stp itp td hld dld code
   doc</tt></LI>
</UL>

<P>Phase types are not required. Even if you specify the phase type for one 
phase, you can omit it for others. If you do specify phase types, the 
dashboard will be able to intelligently calculate metrics like Yield, A/FR, 
and Defect removal efficiency.</P> 

<H2><A NAME="XmlDesc">Step 3: Save your XML process descriptor</A></H2>

<P>Once your XML process descriptor is complete, it is time to save it 
somewhere <A HREF="HowDashboardFindsFiles.html#FindFiles">where the dashboard 
can find it</A>. Follow these steps:</P>

<ol>
 <li>Find your pspdash.jar file (on Windows machines, it is probably located 
   in <U>C:\Program Files\Process Dashboard</U>).</li>
 <li>Create a directory alongside it called "Templates" (e.g., <U>C:\Program 
   Files\Process Dashboard\Templates</U>).</li>
 <li>Save your XML process descriptor in that Templates directory. 
   <B>Important:</B> you must give your XML process descriptor a filename 
   ending with "<code><b>-template.xml</b></code>" to signal to the dashboard 
   that this is an XML process template descriptor.  If you do not choose a 
   filename ending with "<code><b>-template.xml</b></code>", your process 
   descriptor will be ignored.</li>
</ol>

<P>This is the simplest place to put your XML process descriptor. Of course, 
if you want to share your process with team members, you may want to put it 
somewhere else. See the section on <A 
HREF="HowDashboardFindsFiles.html#FindFiles">how the dashboard finds process 
files</A> for more information. Keep in mind that the dashboard will search 
for "<code><b>-template.xml</b></code>" files in the "Templates" directories 
only - subdirectories will not be searched.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Restart">Step 4: Restart the dashboard</A></H2>

<P>Once your XML process descriptor is in place, it is necessary to shut down 
the dashboard and restart it for the new process to be found.  Once found, 
you will automatically have:</P> 

<UL>
 <LI>A template on the hierarchy editor's "Add Template" menu for your 
   process</LI>
 <LI>A template on the hierarchy editor's "Add Template" menu for <B>rolling 
   up</B> data from your process</LI>
 <LI>A custom project plan summary form for your process</LI>
</UL>

<P>That should be enough to get you started! For more advanced topics like</P>

 <LI>Generating charts and tables of your data</LI>

   the data in your process</LI>
