<a name="OverwritingScript"></a><h1>Making a change to a script</h1>

<p>Perhaps the built-in PSP processes suit you well, but you'd like to make 
some small tweak to one of the HTML scripts.  For example, you might like to 
add company specific instructions to some of the steps (to run a code 
analyzer perhaps).</p>

<p>When you're viewing the page in question, you notice it has the URL:</p>

<p><code>http://localhost:2468/Project+Path//<b>psp2.1/develop.htm</b></code></p>

<p>This example uses the PSP2.1 process - other processes will have other text in place of "psp2.1".</p>

<p>Take the following steps:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Find your pspdash.jar file (if you are running on Windows, it should be 
   specified in the shortcut that launches the dashboard -- if you are 
   running on Unix, you should know where the pspdash.jar is located based on 
   where you installed the dashboard!).</li>
 <li>Create a directory alongside it called "Templates".</li>
 <li>Create a subdirectory within "Templates" called "psp2.1".</li>
 <li>Save the current version of the HTML file to the psp2.1 subdirectory. 
   This can be done by choosing &quot;File
   <img src="../../../Images/rarrow.png"> 
   Save As...&quot; from within your web browser. <ul>
   <li>Give the file the same name that appears in the URL - in this
      instance, we would save the file as "develop.htm".  (Note: if the
      URL contains a "?" or "#", just use the filename that appears
      before the "?" or "#".)
   <li>If your web browser has a feature to save "html only", use it.</li>
   </ul>

</li>
 <li>Edit it to your heart's content using the HTML editor of your choice.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, every time you visit that page, for any applicable project in your 
hierarchy, the dashboard will show you the page containing your custom 
changes.</p>

<a name="FindFiles"></a><H1>How the Dashboard finds process files</H1>

<p>When it starts, the dashboard searches for process files and add-ins and 
dynamically loads them.  Also, every time you request a web page from 
<code>http://localhost:2468/</code>, the dashboard is using this same search 
mechanism.</p>

<p>The dashboard searches for files in the following locations, in the 
following order:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Look first in the directory specified by the user setting 
   "templates.directory" (should end in "Templates").</li>

 <li>Next, look in any JAR files contained in that directory.</li>

 <li>Next, look in any JAR files contained in the parent of that 
   directory.</li> 

 <li>If there is a Templates directory alongside the pspdash.jar file, look 
   there, first for the file, then for JARs containing the file.</li>

 <li>If there are any JAR files next to the pspdash.jar file, look in 
   them.</li>

 <li>Finally, look in the classpath (which includes the pspdash.jar file, and 
   contains all the built-in processes).</li>
</ol>

<p>When looking for a particular file, the dashboard will search in the above 
locations and stop as soon as it finds a matching file. This means that if 
you want to customize anything that appears in a process templates directory, 
you can.  Just create your custom version and put it in a location earlier on 
the search list.</p> 

<a name="sharing"></a><h2>Sharing changes with team members</h2>

<p>If you're working with a team, and everyone on your team would like access 
to changes you have made to a process script, you can do the following:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Create a directory somewhere out on a shared network drive, called 
   "Templates" (for example: "<code>T:\Common\Our Team 
   Folder\Templates</code>" on a Windows network, or 
   "<code>/usr/shared/OurTeam/Templates</code>" on a Unix network)</li>
 <li>Have each person on your team edit their configuration file, and add a 
   line for the "templates.directory" setting. (for example: 
   "<code>templates.directory=T:\\Common\\Our Team Folder\\Templates</code>" 
   - the double backslashes are required on Windows systems; Unix systems can 
   just use single forward slashes).</li>
 <li>Put custom versions of files underneath this team templates directory.  
   For example, you could put:
  <ul>
   <li>HTML files overriding files that are built into the dashboard</li>
   <li>LanguageFilters defining custom LOC counters</li>
   <li><a href="DefiningProcesses.html#XmlDef">template.xml</a> files 
      defining team processes</li>
   <li>Data files and HTML scripts/forms supporting those team <a 
      href="DefiningProcesses.html">processes</a></li> 
  </ul>
   and when you make changes to these items, everyone on the team will see 
   them automatically (except as noted below).</li>
</ol>

<h2>Some files are only read at start up</h2>

<p>When you change HTML files, everyone will see your changes immediately.  
The very next time they view the HTML page in question, they will see your 
changes.  Other files, however, the dashboard will only read once.  For 
example, template.xml files, datafiles, and LOC counters will only be read 
once, when the dashboard starts up.  If you make changes to these files, 
people will have to shut down and restart their dashboard to see your 
changes.</p>
