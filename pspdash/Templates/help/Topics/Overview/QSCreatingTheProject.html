<h1>Step 1: Create a project in the dashboard</h1>
<P>The first thing we need to do to get started is to create a new PSP1.1 
project in the dashboard.  To do that, we will start the hierarchy editor by 
choosing Hierarchy from the <a href="../Execution/ConfigureMenu.html">Configure
menu</a>.</P>

<P>We need to decide where to place this project in our work breakdown 
structure.  At this point, we can see the various other projects that have 
been worked on previously (a PSP course).</p>

<P>We will place our PSP1.1 project under the "Project" node like the others.
To do that we will select the "Project" node by clicking it once. Next we will 
pick the "Edit" menu and choose "Add Template" followed by "PSP1.1". This will
add a PSP1.1-based project to the project hierarchy as a child of "Project". 
When the new project is added, it is given a default name.  We can change the 
name to better describe what we are working on.  In this case, we will follow 
the pattern shown and name the project "5A".  For more information on using 
the hierarchy editor, see the <a 
href="../Planning/UsingHierarchyEditor.html">Using the hierarchy editor</a> 
help topic.</P>

<P>Once the project has been created and renamed, click on the little 
expansion control to the left of the 5A project to expand its child nodes in 
the hierarchy tree.  There you can see that the dashboard has placed all the 
process phases for a PSP1.1 project.</p>

<P>Now we can save our changes and close the hierarchy editor via the File 
menu.<p>
