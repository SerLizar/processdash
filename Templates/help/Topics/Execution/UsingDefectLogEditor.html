<H1>Using the Defect Log Editor</H1>

<P>You can use the defect log editor to correct mistakes you might make when 
entering defects.  The defects log editor can be opened by selecting the
"Defect Log" option on the <a href="ConfigureMenu.html">configuration menu</a>.</P>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/DefectLogEditor.png"></p>


<P>The left pane shows the current project hierarchy.  Picking various 
branches on the hierarchy will limit the defect entries displayed to just 
those on the branch chosen.</P>

<P>To change data in the defect entries, just pick on the element that you 
would like to change.  When a particular defect entry is picked, the Edit 
button becomes active.  Clicking the Edit button will bring up the same 
dialog box used to enter defects.  All the defect data can be changed using 
this dialog.  For help using the defect entry dialog please see the <a 
href="EnteringDefects.html">Entering defects</A> help topic.</P>

<P>If defects were logged to the wrong component or task, you can select one
or more defects, then drag them to the correct component in the tree on the
left.  When you drop the defects, they will be moved to the new location.</P>

<P>It's usually most convenient to add individual defects by pressing the 
<a href="EnteringDefects.html">defect button</A> on the main dashboard
toolbar; but you can also add them here. Select the target component first,
then press the Add button.</P>

<P>In addition, it is possible to import bulk defect data from external
sources by clicking the "Import" button.  At the moment, three import sources
are built-in:</p>

<ul>
<li>A wizard for importing defects that have been copied onto the system
    clipboard.  You can use this to copy and paste defect data from a web
    page or a spreadsheet.</li>
<li>A wizard for importing defects from Code Collaborator
    (<u class="url">http://smartbear.com/</u>).</li>
<li>A wizard for importing defects from Review Board
    (<u class="url">http://reviewboard.org/</u>).</li>
</ul>


<h2>Configuring Defect Type Standards</h2>

<p>The dashboard will allow you to configure the &quot;defect type
standards&quot; that you would like to use for various projects.

<P>Defect type standards are associated with projects hierarchically.
By default, projects just inherit the standard chosen by their parent.
In addition, there is a &quot;global default&quot; defect type
standard that is inherited when no other settings have been chosen.

<P>As you select various branches in the project hierarchy, a
component at the bottom of the left pane will show you the defect type
standard setting in effect for the highlighted branch.  You can select
a different defect type standard from the drop-down list provided.
The new value you select will become the default defect type standard
for the highlighted branch of your project hierarchy.

<p>Click on the &quot;More...&quot; button at the bottom of the left pane to: 
<ul>
<li>Edit an existing defect type standard
<li>Create a new defect type standard
<li>Change the global default defect type standard
<li>Import/export defect type standards
</ul>
