<h1>Allowing Team Members to Edit the Work Breakdown Structure</h1>

<p>By default, the dashboard will allow all team members to open the Work
Breakdown Structure and edit tasks.  This is a helpful approach, as it
allows individuals to define new tasks and to refine existing tasks as
needed.  This aligns well with the high-maturity concept of self-directed
teams.</p>

<p>A small number of teams may prefer not to use this approach.  If you do
not want to allow team members to edit the WBS, open the WBS from the Team
Dashboard and choose "Edit&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Preferences".  To prevent team
members from editing the WBS, uncheck the appropriate box.</p>

<h2><a name="indivEditMode"></a>Special Editing Behavior for Team Members</h2>

<p>When an individual team member opens the WBS from their personal
dashboard, the WBS Editor becomes aware of the team member who opened it,
and optimizes the editing behavior for that individual:</p>

<ul>

<li>Newly created tasks are automatically assigned to the individual who
opened the WBS.</li>

<li>If the individual makes a change that affects one of their coworkers,
the WBS will display a warning and offer to undo the change.  (This helps
give team members confidence that they are not altering their teammates
plans accidentally.)</li>

<li>The individual is only allowed to edit their own row in the Team Member
List.</li>

</ul>

<p>These behaviors can be disabled by toggling a checkbox in the WBS
Editor's "Team" menu.  This can be useful if an individual such as the
Planning Manager needs to make a change that affects other team
members.</p>
