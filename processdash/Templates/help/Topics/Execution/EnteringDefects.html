<H1>Entering Defects</H1>

<P>We all make mistakes.  Dealing with those mistakes in a constructive way 
so that we can learn from them is a lot of what process improvement is all
about.</P>

<P>Entering defects in the dashboard is as easy as choosing the defect button.</P>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/PointToDefectButton.png"></p>

<P>When the defect button is chosen, the defect dialog pops up so that you 
can enter information about the defect that you have discovered.</P>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/EnterDefect.png"></p>

<P>In this dialog box, you enter all the data necessary to describe the 
defect.  Each feature of the dialog box is detailed below.</P>

<h2>Defect Type</h2>
<P>The defect type pulldown allows you to choose the type of defect.  The 
choices are determined by the defect type standard that is in effect for
the currently selected project.  You can create new defect type standards,
and configure the defect type standards that should be used for various
projects;  see the <a href="UsingDefectLogEditor.html">defect editor</a>
help topic for more information.</P>

<h2>Defect Date</h2>

<p>This field captures the date the defect was found and/or removed. It
will automatically be filled in with the current date, but you can edit it
if the defect was found or removed in the past.</p>

<h2>Phase Injected and Phase Removed</h2>
<P>The defect injected and defect removed pulldowns allow selection of the 
process phases in which the defect was injected and removed, respectively.
The dashboard will set both of these to what it thinks are appropriate
choices given the current development phase, but that default choice can be
overridden easily.</P>

<p>Sometimes, you might discover a defect, but might not choose to fix it
right away.  (For example, you might need to talk with others to determine
the best course of action for the fix.)  In this case, you can click the
"Removed" label, then select the option indicating that the fix for the
defect is still pending.  After the defect has been fixed, you can use the
<a href="UsingDefectLogEditor.html">Defect Log Editor</a> to re-edit this
defect and change the status to "Removed."</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> changing this "pending" flag will <b>not</b> affect the
defect removal counts that appear on the Project Plan Summary form for your
project.  Those removal counts will still include "pending" defects, even
though the defects aren't officially removed.  This behavior allows the
defect calculations (such as yield, defect density, and defect removal
rate) to continue working as expected.</p>

<a name="timing"></a><h2>Timing the Defect Fix</h2>
<P>The defect dialog has its own built in timer independent of the main 
dashboard timer.  By default, when the dialog first appears, it starts timing 
the fix of the defect.  The fix time display will show the time passing.  The 
intent of this behavior is that most people will discover a defect, push the 
defect button on the dashboard and immediately start fixing the defect.  In 
this scenario, the dialog will immediately start timing the fix.  This 
behavior can be changed via an entry in the preferences editor.  Adding the 
following advanced setting will cause the defect dialog to appear without
starting the defect timer.</P>

<PRE>defectDialog.autostart=false</PRE>

<P>For more information about making this configuration change see the <a 
href="../AdvancedTopics/ConfigurationFile.html">advanced settings</a> help 
topic.</P>

<P>The play and pause buttons allow starting and stopping of the defect 
timer.  If you stop fixing the given defect but are not finished with the 
fix, you can press this button to stop the timer.</P>

<P>The defect fix timer can be started and stopped independently of the main
dashboard timer. However, if both timers are running and you pause the main
dashboard timer, the defect fix timer will pause too.  After being paused in
this way, if you restart the main dashboard timer, the defect timer will
restart as well.</p>

<P>In any case, you can stop the timer and enter a specific time in the fix 
time display box.</P>

<h2>Fix Count</h2>

<p>Sometimes, you may find and fix several related defects.  (For example,
during the compile phase, the compiler might identify four missing
semicolons, and you might fix all of them at once.)  To simplify defect
entry, you can make one entry in your defect log describing all of the
defects, then enter the number of distinct defects in the "Fix Count"
field.</p>

<p>Most of the time, however, you will leave the count at its default value
of 1.  You should only use the Fix Count field when all of the defects in
question have the same type, injection/removal phase, and description.  If
you use the Fix Count field to record several unrelated defects, it will
thwart your ability to analyze the defect data effectively.</p>

<p>As a very special case, you can enter the number "0" in this field to
indicate that something isn't really a defect after all, or that it is a
defect but should be ignored when calculating quality metrics.  (For example,
this might be appropriate if you find and fix a defect in legacy code that you
did not write.) If you enter a zero in this field, the defect will still
appear in defect logs and other reports, but it will not contribute to the
"Defects Injected" or "Defects Removed" counts on the plan summary form.  As
such, it will not affect calculations for yield, defect density, defect
removal rates, or other quality metrics.</p>


<a name="fixDefects"></a><h2>Fix Defect</h2>
<P>The "Fix Defect" entry is where you can put the ID number of another 
defect if this is a "fix defect".  A fix defect is a defect that was 
injected while fixing another defect.  In order to determine the ID number of 
the other defect, you can pull up the defect editor by choosing "Defect Log" 
on the "C" menu.  One of the columns of information about each defect will 
show the ID number.  For more information about using the Defect Log see the 
<a href="UsingDefectLogEditor.html">Using the defect log editor</a> help 
topic.</P>

<P>The "new fix defect" button to the right of the ID entry provides another 
way to enter a fix defect.  Consider the following relatively common case.  
You are fixing a bug (so you already have the defect dialog open and it is 
timing your fix).  You edit your code and save the changes.  You compile and 
link to run a test to verify your fix.  Immediately you notice that your fix 
broke something else.  At this point, you can click the new fix defect button 
to get a second defect dialog (to enter this new defect).  This second dialog 
will have the ID number of the previous defect already entered in the ID 
entry blank.  You can now input data relating to this new fix defect. The 
following screenshot shows two defect dialogs open.  The second dialog (the 
one on top) is being used to enter a fix defect.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/QSTwoDefectDialogs.png"></p>

<p>This process works with defects that you edit from within the defect log 
editor as well.  See the section below on <a 
href="#fixingMultipleDefects">fixing multiple defects</a> for more discussion 
on having two defect dialogs open at once.</P> 


<h2>Entering a description</h2>

<P>The defect description pane is where you record a description of the
defect.  To facilitate effective process improvement, you should describe
the underlying defect itself, and not just the outward symptom of the
defect.  (For example, an outward symptom might be that the program hangs,
while the underlying problem might have been forgetting to increment the
index variable in a loop.)</P>

<a name="fixingMultipleDefects"></a><h2>Fixing multiple defects at a time</h2>

<P>If you have the need to fix more than one defect at one time, you can do 
so by simply pushing the defect button on the dashboard again to display 
another defect dialog.  When this happens, the timer on the first dialog will 
stop (if it was running) and the new defect dialog's timer will start 
recording time for the new defect.  This new defect will become the "current" 
defect.  When this new defect dialog is dismissed, the most previously opened 
defect dialog will become the current defect.  It will pop to the front and 
its timer will start up again (if it had been running previously).</P>

<P>In this way you can keep an arbitrary number of defect dialogs open at 
once.  If this is to be done, we recommend that you enter a description of 
the defect into the dialog box as soon as it is opened so that when it comes 
back to the front as the currently active defect, it will be clear what you 
were working on.</P>
