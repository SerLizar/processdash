<H1>Team Use - Earned Value Only</H1>

If your project team is small (only a few people), and you only need
to manage project cost and schedule, you can use the Earned Value
Collaboration Features that are built in to the dashboard to generate
a rolled-up earned value schedule.  This functionality is described in
the &quot;<a href="../Planning/TaskScheduleCollaboration.html">Task
&amp; Schedule Collaboration</a>&quot; help topic.</p>

<p>The main advantage of this approach is that it is fairly simple to
use: graphical user interfaces are provided to walk you through the
steps involved in rolling up an earned value schedule.  This approach
works well for small teams, and is <b>very</b> useful for ad-hoc
planning (two or three individuals who wish to informally coordinate
their work).</p>

<p>The main disadvantage of this approach is that it uses peer-to-peer
network communication.  When you view the rolled up schedule, the
dashboard automatically retrieves up-to-date versions of each
sub-schedule.  If your project contains many people, this process may
take time.  In addition, if any team members are not running their
personal dashboard at the time, the rollup will be unable to retrieve
that person's sub-schedule, and will have to use a previously cached
version instead.  As a result, if you have many people on your project
team, or if the people on your project team do not typically leave the
Process Dashboard running, this approach may not be best for you;
consider using the <a href="TeamUsePSPEV.html">PSP/EV rollup
approach</a> instead.</p>
