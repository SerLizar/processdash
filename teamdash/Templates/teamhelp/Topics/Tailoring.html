<h1>Tailoring the Process Dashboard for Your Organization</h1>

<p>Every organization is different, and high-maturity teams have
differing needs from their metrics support tools.  The Process
Dashboard strives to meet these needs by offering a high degree of
customizability to support different processes.</p>

<p>Still, not every organization needs extensive customizability. Many
organizations, for example, would be content to use the standardized
metrics collection framework and process forms historically described by
the Team Software Process<sup> (SM)</sup>.  Fortunately, the Software
Engineering Institute has graciously allowed us to distribute a metrics
collection framework based upon those materials.  You can download this
from our website at <u>http://www.processdash.com/</u></p>

<td>If your organization has special metrics collection needs (for
example, if your team does not write software), you should plan for
and set aside time to perform the process customization steps (listed
in the sections below) <u>before</u> you need to use the dashboard in
support of a particular team project.</td>
