<h1>Tracking Task Dependencies</h1>

<p>Creating a schedule with the <a href="UsingTaskSchedule.html">Task and
Schedule</a> tool, and tracking your progress with earned value, is an
excellent way to stay on track and deliver your work on time.  But when you
are working as part of a team, it is also important to coordinate with your
team members.  This is especially true if your team member needs to use
something that you are producing (or vice versa).  To facilitate this type of
coordination, the dashboard will allow you to define and track task
dependencies.  <i><b>Note:</b> if you are not working as a member of a team,
you probably don't need to declare task dependencies.</i></p>

<p>Task dependencies are a way of stating, &quot;<i>this</i> task cannot start
until <i>those</i> tasks are finished.&quot; You can define dependencies
between tasks that appear in earned value schedules.  Once defined, the
dashboard will help you to track the status of these dependencies, as
described below. However, the presence of dependencies does not currently
alter the earned value calculations in any way.  In particular, <b>the
dashboard does not use these dependencies to perform any sort of critical path
analysis</b>.  If you use "Flat View" to specify task order, the dashboard
does not prevent you from reordering tasks before their predecessors.  These
capabilities may be added in the future.  But at the current time, task
dependencies are simply a way of showing you the information you need in order
to coordinate with your teammates more effectively.</p>

<p>There are two different ways you can define task dependencies:<ul>

<li>When your team is planning a team project, you can define dependencies
in the Work Breakdown Struture Editor.</li>

<li>When you view an earned value schedule in the
<a href="UsingTaskSchedule.html">Task and Schedule</a> window, you can
define dependencies by double-clicking on a cell in the "Dep" column.</li></ul>

Most teams will use the first approach almost exclusively.</p>

<p>Once you've defined a task dependency, the dashboard will display icons to
indicate the presence and status of dependent tasks.  If a task has a
dependency, one of the following icons will be displayed:</p>


<table style="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm">

<tr><td nowrap><b style="color:red">???</b></td>
    <td>This depends on at least one other task, but status information
        for that task is not available.</td></tr>

<tr><td style="font-size:2px">&nbsp;</td></tr>

<tr><td><img src="../../../Images/stop.gif"></td>
    <td>This depends on at least one other task that still has not been
        completed.</td></tr>

<tr><td style="font-size:2px">&nbsp;</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" style="padding-top:6px"><img src="../../../Images/warningRed.gif"></td>
    <td><a name="redWarning"></a>This depends on at least one other task that
        still has not been completed - and unfortunately, it does not look
        like the dependent task(s) will be ready as soon as you need them to
        be.<a href="#misordered">*</a></td></tr>

<tr><td style="font-size:2px">&nbsp;</td></tr>

<tr><td><img src="../../../Images/check.png"></td>
    <td>All of the dependencies for this task have been completed.</td></tr>

<tr><td style="font-size:2px">&nbsp;</td></tr>

<tr><td><img src="../../../Images/group.gif"></td>
    <td>Other people are waiting for you to complete this task.</td></tr>

<tr><td style="font-size:2px">&nbsp;</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" style="padding-top:6px"><img src="../../../Images/warning.gif"></td>
    <td><a name="yellowWarning"></a>Other people are waiting for you to
        complete this task - and unfortunately, it does not look like you
        will complete this task in time to meet their needs.<a
        href="#misordered">*</a></td></tr>

</table>



<p>These icons are displayed in the "Dep" column of the task list when it
appears in the Task and Schedule window, the earned value report, or the
earned value weekly view.  In addition, the icon will be displayed on the main
dashboard window when you select a task that has a related dependency:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../../Images/MainWindowDependencyIndicator.png"></p>

<p>You can place your mouse over these icons for detailed status information.
(When you see a dependency icon in your web browser, you'll need to click as
well.)  The detailed status will show you all the dependent tasks (if there is
more than one), the completion status of each, the names of the individuals
assigned to the task, the projected<a href="#projectedDate">**</a> completion
date, and the task's percentage complete.</p>


<h2><A NAME="misordered"></A>Misordered Dependencies</h2>

<p>As described above, task dependencies are a way of stating,
&quot;<i>this</i> task cannot start until <i>those</i> tasks are
finished.&quot; Accordingly, when task dependencies are present, it becomes
necessary to work on tasks in a particular order.</p>

<p>However, the dashboard does not perform any critical path analysis on your
task dependencies, and it does not attempt to compute the optimal order in
which tasks should be performed.  Thus, you must collaborate with your
teammates to determine the best task order.</p>

<p>Once you decide which tasks you will be working on first, second, etc, you
should use the <a href="TaskScheduleSteps.html#flatView">flat view</a> of your
task list to record this order in the dashboard.  The dashboard will then use
this order to compute projected completion dates for each task.</p>

<p>Once all team members have performed this step, the dashboard will compare
the projected<a href="#projectedDate">**</a> task dates to see if any
dependent tasks have been placed out of order.  For example, imagine the
following scenario:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>Person A is working on Task A, and is projected to complete it
      by June 1.</li>

  <li>Person B is working on Task B, and is projected to complete it
      by May 1.</li>

  <li>Task B cannot start until Task A is complete</li>

  </ul>

<p>Obviously, the tasks are misordered!  In this case, Person A would see a
<a href="#yellowWarning">yellow warning sign</a> next to Task A, with a
message "Other individuals need this task earlier than it is projected to
finish."  Person B would see a <a href="#redWarning">red warning sign</a>
next to Task B, with a message "This dependent task is not projected to
finish in time."</p>

<p>When you see these warning icons, it is a sign that you need to coordinate
with your team members to resolve the problem!  It is possible that the other
individual just hasn't bothered to record the task order in their <a
href="TaskScheduleSteps.html#flatView">flat view</a> yet.  Or, it could be an
indication of a serious scheduling problem.  Either way, a conversation with
your team member is in order.  If your team uses task dependencies, it is
best for each team member to use flat view faithfully so the dashboard can
provide the most useful information for team collaboration.</p>

<h2><A NAME="projectedDate"></A>Dependency Dates</h2>

<p> By default, the dashboard uses the calculated "Replan" date as the
"Projected" date for dependency tracking purposes.  This means:</p>

<ul>

  <li>When you request details for a dependency, the dates displayed are
      replan dates.</li>

  <li>When two tasks are compared for misordering, the comparison is made
      between the replan dates for the two tasks.</li>

</ul>

<p>The "Replan" date is a good choice for dependency tracking purposes because
it takes actual data into account, but is not typically as volatile as the
forecast date.  If you prefer to use "Plan" or "Forecast" dates for dependency
tracking purposes instead, specify a value for the
<tt>ev.dependencies.compareDates</tt> setting in the
<a href="../AdvancedTopics/ConfigurationFile.html">preferences editor</a>.</p>
