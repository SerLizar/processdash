<h1>Process Dashboard Mobile Companion App</h1>

<p>A mobile smartphone application is available for use with the Process
Dashboard.</p>

<p>The mobile app works alongside the Process Dashboard, making it possible
to perform a number of common tasks from an iPhone, iPad, or Android
device:</p>

<ul>

<li>Seeing the tasks that are assigned to you</li>

<li>Logging time, and editing past time log entries</li>

<li>Altering the planned time for a task</li>

<li>Marking tasks complete</li>

</ul>


<p>The mobile application <b>does not replace</b> the Process Dashboard.
In particular, you will still need to open the full Process Dashboard
periodically on your computer to "export" your data for team rollups.  But
it can be useful as a way to collect project data when you are away from
your computer.</p>

<p>To get started using the mobile application, click the Next button
below.</p>
