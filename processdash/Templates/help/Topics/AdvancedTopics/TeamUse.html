<H1>Team Use</H1>

The Process Dashboard includes extensive functionality which can be used by
high-maturity project teams.  This functionality will be most useful and
intuitive to projects that are applying the Team Software
Process<sup>(SM)</sup>.  However, since the dashboard's team functionality is
general-purpose, it can be used effectively by non-TSP<sup>(SM)</sup> and
non-software teams.</p>
