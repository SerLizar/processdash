<p>Building upon the flexibility of the world-wide-web, the dashboard
displays many scripts, forms, and reports in your web browser.  See
the <a href="HowToInstall.html">Installation</A> help topic for more
info about which web browsers are supported and how to install them if
necessary.</P>

<P>The<a name="webServer"></a> connection between the dashboard and the 
browser is facilitated by a very small web server that is running within the 
dashboard.  It is this web server, combined with some Java scripting, that 
provides all the live data communication between the dashboard and the 
browser.  One consequence of this is that the various reports and charts that 
are displayed within the browser will not be available unless the dashboard 
is running.</P> 

<h2><A name="psp"></A>The PSP Process Scripts</h2>

<p class="ifpsp">An add-on module for the Process Dashboard provides nearly
all the scripts defined in the book <I>A&nbsp;Self-Improvement Process for
Software Engineers</i> by Watts Humphrey.</p>

<p class="unlesspsp">An add-on module for the Process Dashboard is
available that provides nearly all the scripts defined in the book
<I>A&nbsp;Self-Improvement Process for Software Engineers</i> by Watts
Humphrey.  However, this add-on must be distributed as a separate
download from the Process Dashboard.  (For more information, <a
href="Separation.html">click here</a>.)  To download the PSP process
definitions, visit <u>http://www.processdash.com</u></p>

<p>The PSP forms and scripts in this add-on module are designed to be
as close to the "real thing" as possible (the "real thing" being the
forms and tables in Watts Humphrey's book).  Where the online forms
and scripts deviate, the text is color coded as follows:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Where the dashboard makes a certain step unnecessary the text is colored 
   in grey (e.g. writing entries in a time log).</li>
 <li>Where the dashboard changes the way a certain step is performed, the 
   text is colored in green (e.g. using the PROBE tool or the PROBE wizard 
   instead of performing statistical calculations via a calculator or 
   spreadsheet).</li>
</ul>

<P>Many of the process forms contain links to other forms that are used at 
that process level, making navigation through the forms simple and 
intuitive.  Also, many of the process scripts contain little stopwatch icons 
on them.  These icons provide another way to navigate and time a process 
phase.  When you click on one of these icons, the current phase being 
measured will change to the phase indicated by the icon and the timer will 
start measuring time for that phase.</p>

<P>For information on how to access the forms, see the <a 
href="../Execution/AccessingScripts.html">Accessing process scripts</a> help 
topic.</p>

<p>The following lists detail the forms and scripts provided by the dashboard 
at each PSP level.  Items marked by <sup>*</sup> are "live" forms that either 
update themselves with process data (e.g. the project summary forms) or can 
be expanded as necessary to permit multiple data entry (e.g. the size 
estimating template or the PSP3 cycle summary form).</p>

<h2><A name="generic"></A>The "generic" process script</h2>
<P>Very much of the methodology that is employed by the PSP can be used in 
other endeavors.  Any kind of work that has measurable time, size, and/or
defects can probably benefit from a PSP-like process.  The generic process 
scripts attempt to give rudimentary measurement and defect tracking for other 
work efforts.</p>

<P>When you create a project based on the generic process in the <a
href="../Planning/UsingHierarchyEditor.html">hierarchy editor</a>, it will
initially contain only a planning phase and a postmortem phase.  You can
then add additional phases (and give them any names that you want) by
selecting the node corresponding to the generic project, then selecting
"Generic Phase" from the "Add Template" menu:</P>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/ShowAddGenericPhase.png"></p>

<P>The generic process then creates a tailored project plan summary form.  It
allows entry of time and size estimates, and even lets you enter the unit of
size measurement.  For example, you could run the generic process to measure
and track your progress as you write a technical paper.  The size unit would
end up being something related to the work of writing (perhaps pages).  The
generic process would capture your productivity rates and allow you to enter
defects.  Estimation support would also be available through the PROBE
tool.</p>

<h2><A name="timer"></A>The "timer" process script</h2>
<P>The timer process allows for estimating and measuring activities that have 
only a time aspect to them.  If you regularly perform some kind of task that 
pretty much remains the same each time, you could record estimates and times 
for that task to attempt to provide some engineering discipline.</p>

<h2><A name="custom"></A>Custom process scripts</h2>

<P>The dashboard has been designed from the ground up to support custom
processes.  The PSP scripts and forms that you see are not hard-coded into the
tool; instead, they are dynamically loaded from simple HTML and text files.
Thus, it is possible to create your own custom process scripts, forms, and
data that will be dynamically integrated into the dashboard.

<P>More information on creating custom processes is available in the <a href="../AdvancedTopics/ProcessDefinition/DefiningProcesses.html"> Advanced
Topics</a> section of the help.

<h2>Custom process vs Generic process?</h2>

<P>When should you use the generic process, and when should you create a
custom process?  In general, you should use the generic process:</P>

<UL>
<LI>If the process for this task is unlikely to be reused in the future (for
example, because the task at hand is a departure from the work you normally
do).</LI>

<LI>If the process for this task is still immature and uncertain.  As you
begin creating your own custom process definitions, the flexibility of the
generic process will allow you to radically change your process from one task
to the next in response to process improvement proposals.  Once you decide
upon and finalize the <u>list of phases</u> in your process, you are ready to
begin using a custom process script.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The generic script gives you a lot of flexibility - the phase names and
other process specifics can change from task to task, or even in the middle of
a generic project!  This flexibility comes at a price, however: without an
unchanging process definition, it isn't possible to compare "apples to apples"
across numerous generic processes.  Therefore, the generic process cannot
calculate "to date" data like a custom process can.  On the other hand, a
change to your process definition can potentially invalidate all the
historical data you've collected, so it is best to wait and define a custom
process when you feel you've confidently identified its phases.</P>

<h2>The Team Process</h2>

<p>The dashboard also includes a sophisticated metrics collection framework
designed to support team projects.  The team project template allows you and
your teammates the ability to define arbitrary hierarchial structures of
project subcomponents and tasks.  It makes it easy to allocate and reassign
work between team members, and it automatically rolls up individual data to
the team level.  If you plan to collaborate with other individuals, you
should use the team process.</p>

<a href="../../../teamhelp/Topics/Overview.html">Team Use</a> section of
the Users Manual.</p>
