<H1>The process scripts</h1>
<P>The Process Dashboard provides nearly all the scripts defined in <I>A 
Discipline for Software Engineering</i> by Watts Humphrey.  In all cases, the 
forms and scripts were designed to be as close to the "real thing" as 
possible (the "real thing" being the forms and tables in Appendix C of Watts 
Humphrey's book).  Where the online forms and scripts deviate, the text is 
color coded as follows:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Where the dashboard makes a certain step unnecessary the text is colored 
   in grey (e.g. writing entries in a time log).</li>
 <li>Where the dashboard changes the way a certain step is performed, the 
   text is colored in green (e.g. using the PROBE tool instead of performing 
   statistical calculations via a calculator or spreadsheet).</li>
</ul>

<P>Many of the process forms contain links to other forms that are used at 
that process level, making navigation through the forms simple and 
intuitive.</p>

<P>For information on how to access the forms, see the <a 
href="../Execution/AccessingScripts.html">Accessing process scripts</a> help 
topic.</p>

<p>The following lists detail the forms and scripts provided by the dashboard 
at each PSP level.  Items marked by <sup>*</sup> are "live" forms that either 
update themselves with process data (e.g. the project summary forms) or can 
be expanded as necessary to permit multiple data entry (e.g. the size 
estimating template or the PSP3 cycle summary form).</p>

<P>Starting at PSP level 2, the Project Plan Summary form gets large enough 
that it is presented in a frames view so that different pieces of it can be 
seen.  The full view is also available.  These items are marked by 
<sup>**</sup> in these lists.</p>

<h2>The "generic" process script</h2>
<P>Very much of the methodology that is employed by the PSP can be used in 
other endeavors.  Any kind of work that has measurable time, size, and/or
defects can probably benefit from a PSP-like process.  The generic process 
scripts attempt to give rudimentary measurement and defect tracking for other 
work efforts.</p>

<P>The generic process script always contains a planning and a postmortem
phase.  Additional phases with custom names can be added with the <a
href="../Planning/UsingHierarchyEditor.html">hierarchy editor</a>.  The
generic process then creates a tailored project plan summary form.  It allows
entry of time and size estimates, and even lets you enter the unit of size
measurement.  For example, you could run the generic process to measure and
track your progress as you write a technical paper.  The size unit would end
up being something related to the work of writing (perhaps pages).  The
generic process would capture your productivity rates and allow you to enter
defects.  Estimation support would also be available through the PROBE
tool.</p>

<h2>The "timer" process script</h2>
<P>The timer process allows for estimating and measuring activities that have 
only a time aspect to them.  If you regularly perform some kind of task that 
pretty much remains the same each time, you could record estimates and times 
for that task to attempt to provide some engineering discipline.</p>

<h2>Custom process scripts</h2>

<P>The dashboard has been designed from the ground up to support custom
processes.  The PSP scripts and forms that you see are not hardcoded into the
tool; instead, they are dynamically loaded from simple HTML and text files.
Thus, it is possible to create your own custom process scripts, forms, and
data that will be dynamically integrated into the dashboard.

<P>A "process wizard," capable of creating a custom process from parameters
you specify, should be available soon.  Visit our website for details, at
<U>http://processdash.sourceforge.net</U>.

<h2>Custom process vs Generic process?</h2>

<P>When should you use the generic process, and when should you create a
custom process?  In general, you should use the generic process:</P>

<UL>
<LI>If the process for this task is unlikely to be reused in the future (for
example, because the task at hand is a departure from the work you normally
do).</LI>

<LI>If the process for this task is still immature and uncertain.  As you
begin creating your own custom process definitions, the flexibility of the
generic process will allow you to radically change your process from one task
to the next in response to process improvement proposals.  Once you decide
upon and finalize the <u>list of phases</u> in your process, you are ready to
begin using a custom process script.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The generic script gives you a lot of flexibility - the phase names and
other process specifics can change from task to task, or even in the middle of
a generic project!  This flexibility comes at a price, however: without an
unchanging process definition, it isn't possible to compare "apples to apples"
across numerous generic processes.  Therefore, the generic process cannot
calculate "to date" data like a custom process can.  On the other hand, a
change to your process definition can potentially invalidate all the
historical data you've collected, so it is best to wait and define a custom
process when you feel you've confidently identified its phases.</P>
