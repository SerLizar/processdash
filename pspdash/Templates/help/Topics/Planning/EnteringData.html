<H1>Entering process data</H1>
<P>There are two main ways of entering data into the Process Dashboard.  The 
first is through various input tools and dialogs provided by the dashboard 
(e.g. the <a href="UsingProbeTool.html">PROBE tool</a>, the <a 
href="../Execution/EnteringDefects.html">defect dialog</a>, etc.).</p>

<p>The second is through the various PSP forms.  The forms are provided
through a web interface.  See the <a
href="../Execution/AccessingScripts.html">Accessing Process Scripts</a>
help topic for more info on how to access the scripts.  To find out
more information about the different process scripts that are available,
see the <a href="../Overview/ProcessScripts.html">process scripts</a> help
topic.</p>


<!-- DISCLAIMER -->

<h2>The nature of the script files</h2>
<P>The script files themselves are implemented via static and sometimes 
dynamic HTML pages.  The dashboard software actually contains a very small 
HTTP server embedded within it.  This server allows communication between the 
HTML pages and the process data that is tracked by the dashboard.</P>

<P>The HTML pages are "live" at all times.  To enter process data, you merely 
need to click on the appropriate data entry elements and type in the data.  
Once you pick anywhere else on the page (to signal that you are finished 
entering information), the dashboard will automatically pick up your data -- 
no need to press any kind of "submit data" button.</P>

<h2>Exporting form data</h2>

<p>When you open a dashboard form, the form connects to the process
dashboard to retrieve the most up-to-date values for all the data elements
on the page.  If you choose the &quot;File -&gt; Save&quot; option from
your browser, you will find that only the form is saved; the values
contained in the form are not.  If you want to save an electronic copy of a
dashboard form (for example, to email to a coworker, or to save with
project documentation), click the &quot;Export to HTML&quot; link at the
bottom of the page.  The dashboard will create an HTML version of the form
containing a <i>snapshot</i> of your data.  This HTML snapshot can be saved
using the &quot;File -&gt; Save&quot; option of your browser.</p>

<p>If you would like to perform additional analysis on the data in a
dashboard form, use the &quot;Export to Excel&quot; link at the bottom of
the page. This will open the form in Excel, where you can reference the
data in Excel charts and equations.  <b>Important:</b> the Excel version of
the form contains <i>exported</i> data only.  If you edit values in the
Excel spreadsheet, your changes will not be imported back into the Process
Dashboard. To change a data value in the Process Dashboard, you must make
the change in a dashboard form.</p>

<h2>Read-only data fields</h2>

<P>The Process Dashboard automatically calculates many data elements for
you.  Normally, these calculated data values are not directly editable, but
rather they will update when other data elements to which they are related
get updated.  If you are using Internet Explorer, these values are
displayed with a grey background.</p>

<P>Sometimes you may decide that you want to <b> override</b> one or more
of these calculated values.  You can "unlock" these read-only data elements
by clicking on the &quot;<u>Unlock read-only data</u>&quot; link at the
bottom of the page.  Unlocking read-only data will make all the elements on
the page editable, allowing you to override calculated values with your
own.</p>

<P>Unlocking read-only data is useful for times when you intentionally want
to override a calculation, but it is not without risk.  Once you have
overridden a calculation, it will no longer automatically update in
response to changes in related data items.  In addition, related
calculations may no longer add up like you would normally expect.
Therefore, this feature should be used with caution.</p>

<p>After you have overridden a calculation with some value, you may decide
that you want the old calculation back.  Just type<code><b> DEFAULT
</b></code>in the input field, and when you leave the field the old
calculation will be restored.</p>
