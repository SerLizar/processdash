<H1>Using the Task &amp; Schedule Tool</H1>

<P>The task and schedule tool allows you to generate a schedule for 
completing tasks, and track progress against that schedule using earned 
value. You can open the task and schedule tool by selecting the 
&quot;Task &amp; Schedule&quot; option on the
<a href="../Execution/ConfigureMenu.html">configure menu</a>.</P>

<P>If you haven't created any schedules, the dashboard will immediately
jump to the Create New Schedule dialog which will allow you to create one. 
If you have already created at least one schedule, a Task &amp; Schedule
chooser window will appear.</P>

<p><center><img src="../../Images/TaskScheduleChooser.png"></center></p>

<p>This window displays all the schedules you have created. After you click
on a schedule to highlight it, you can use the buttons along the bottom to
open it, rename it, or delete it. The Cancel button will close this window.</p>

<p>Clicking the New button will create a new schedule. The dashboard will ask 
you to enter a name for the new schedule.  This allows you to track different 
schedules from within the dashboard. When a new schedule is first created, an 
empty Task &amp; Schedule window will appear prompting you for the first task 
you want to add to the schedule.</p> 

<p><center><img src="../../Images/AddTaskToSchedule.png"></center></p>

<p>All the tasks that are to be tracked within the schedule must come from 
the project hierarchy defined using the <a 
href="UsingHierarchyEditor.html">Hierarchy Editor</a>.  You can track 
progress against PSP projects, projects you have made using custom process 
scripts or add-on process sets, or even against just a hierarchy of task 
names that are not associated with a particular process in the dashboard.  
The Task &amp; Schedule tool is completely process independent.</p>

<P>The Task &amp; Schedule window combines a project task list and a
simple project schedule into one window.  The top portion of the
window gives a view of the task schedule on a task by task basis and
tracks metrics about each task.  The bottom portion of the window is
concerned with actual calendar time.  The time for the schedule is
broken out into time periods (e.g. weeks) and the columns track
metrics about each time period.</p>

<p><center><img src="../../Images/TaskSchedule.png"></center></p>

<p>Editable values appear with a yellow background. If you are unfamiliar 
with the various columns in the task and schedule planning templates, you can 
hover the pointer over the column headings and a tool tip will tell you what 
the abbreviated heading stands for.</p>

<h2>Columns in the Task List</h2>

<P>While this help topic won't get into all the details of earned value 
tracking, briefly here are the items that are shown in the upper window:</p>

<p><b>Planned Time (PT):</b> This is the amount of time you have planned for 
the given task.</p>

<p><b>Time</b> This is the actual amount of time spent on a given task.</p>

<p><b>Planned Value (PV):</b> This is the amount of earned value that will be 
earned by the given task based on the planned numbers.</p>

<p><b>Plan Date:</b> This is the date that the Task &amp; Schedule tool thinks 
you will finish the given task.  This number uses the data from the lower 
half of the Task &amp; Schedule tool to determine an ending date.</p>

<p><b>Date:</b> This is the actual completion date.  It will be filled in 
automatically when you mark the task complete via the <a 
href="../Execution/CompletionButton.html">Completion Button</a></p>

<p><b>Percent Complete (%C):</b> This is the percent complete for the
current task.  Many people are accustomed to informally estimating
percent complete; PSP formalizes this concept:<ul>

  <li>If a task has no subtasks, it will either be 0% complete or 100%
      complete, based upon whether you have marked it complete via the
      <a href="../Execution/CompletionButton.html">Completion Button</a>.</li>

  <li>If a task has subtasks, its percent complete is calculated by
      using the planned times of those tasks to compute a weighted
      average.</li>

</ul>At times you might wish for the ability to edit the "percent
complete" for a task because it is "90% done."  Unfortunately, this
often leads to tasks that reach 90% complete and stay there for weeks,
slipping the schedule.  PSP states that instead, you should break the
task down into subtasks and mark some of those subtasks complete.
That way, you will get an accurate measure of percent complete.</p>

<p><b>Percent Spent (%S):</b> This number describes the relationship
between planned time and actual time for the given task.  If you have
spent twice as much time on this task as you planned to spend, it
would be 200% spent.  If you have only used up half of the planned
time, the task would be 50% spent.</p>

<p><b>Earned Value (EV):</b> This is the actual amount of earned value that 
this task has earned.  <i>Remember that earned value measures are not counted 
until the task is marked as complete.</i></p>


<p><b>Note:</b> The columns listed above are sufficient for most
simple planning.  As a result, the task list will usually only display
the columns listed above.  For advanced planning, however, some
additional information must also be displayed.  Therefore, the
following columns will automatically appear if: <ul>
<li>You manually prune subtasks out of your hierarchical task list
<li>You logged time to any of the tasks in your task list before
    the starting date of your schedule
<li>You completed any of the tasks in your task list before the
    starting date of your schedule
</ul></p>

<p><b>Planned Direct Time (PDT):</b> The &quot;Planned Time&quot;
column (described above) displays the <u>total</u> amount of time you
plan to spend on a task, no matter when that time gets spent.  In
contrast, the &quot;Planned Direct Time&quot; column displays the
amount of effort you plan to spend as part of <u>this schedule</u>.</p>

<p>An example can help illustrate the difference.  Imagine that one of
the tasks on your task list is to write a large software module. It
might have subtasks for requirements, design, implementation, and
formal testing.  The total amount of time needed to complete all of
these subtasks would be displayed in the &quot;Planned Time&quot;
column.  Now suppose you already completed requirements and design,
and started on the implementation, as part of an earlier project
iteration.  Furthermore, you don't plan to begin formal testing until
the next project iteration.  The &quot;Planned Direct Time&quot; for
requirements, design, and formal testing would be zero, since you
don't intend to spend any time on them during the current project
phase.  Also, since you already performed some of the work for the
implementation task, only the remaining portion of its planned time
would appear in the &quot;Planned Direct Time&quot; column.</p>

<p>The &quot;Planned Direct Time&quot; column will only be displayed
if it differs from the &quot;Planned Time&quot; column for at least
one task in your task list.  When it appears, you will note that the
&quot;plan value&quot; for a task is based on its planned direct time,
not its planned time.</p>

<p><b>Actual Direct Time (DTime):</b> The &quot;Actual Time&quot;
column displays the <u>total</u> amount of time you have spend on a
task to date, no matter when that time was spent.  In contrast, the
&quot;Actual Direct Time&quot; column displays the amount of effort
you have spent as part of <u>this schedule</u>.</p>



<h2>Columns in the Schedule List</h2>

<p>Briefly, here are the items that are shown in the bottom window:</p>

<p><b>From:</b> This is the starting date for a portion of your work 
schedule.  The schedule can start anytime and can be of just about any length 
(one week in duration, one day, one month, etc.).</p>

<p><b>To:</b> This is the ending date for a portion of your work
schedule.  Using the From and To fields, you can break your schedule
up into managable time chunks.  The Task &amp; Schedule tool defaults
to using time periods of one week in length, but you can edit the To
field to create time periods of any length (e.g. months, days, or even
hours).</p>

<p><b>Planned Direct Time (PT):</b> This is the amount of time that will be 
applied to the tasks in the task list during the calendar time period 
selected by the From and To fields.  It defaults to 20 hours, but can be set 
to whatever number you think is accurate for the amount of time you will 
actually spend on task <i>during the given time period</i>.  Note that this 
is the total amount of time you plan on spending on <i>ALL</i> of the tasks 
listed in the top window.  The default numbers on the Task &amp; Schedule 
tool work out to 20 hours per week of work on task.</p>

<p><b>Cumulative Planned Direct Time (CPT):</b> This is the Planned Direct 
Time of the given time period, plus the times of all previous periods.</p>

<p><b>Cumulative Planned Value (CPV):</b> This shows cumulatively the amount 
of earned value that is planned for the given time period.</p>

<p><b>Actual Direct Time (Time):</b> This shows the actual amount of direct 
time spent on the tasks in the schedule during the given time period.</p>

<p><b>Cumulative Actual Direct Time (CT):</b> This shows the actual amount of 
direct time spent on task during the given time period cumulatively.</p>

<p><b>Actual Cumulative Earned Value (EV):</b> This shows the amount of earned 
value actually earned during the given time period cumulatively.</p>


<h1>Creating a schedule step by step</h1>

<p>The Task &amp; Schedule tool tries to make entering all the data necessary 
for project planning and tracking as painless as possible.  It fills in many 
of the columns automatically. The following discussion will show how to 
create a schedule step by step.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Add tasks to the task list</h2>

<p>To create a schedule, you decide what tasks you want included in the 
schedule, and add them with the Add Task button. You can add any node in 
your hierarchy to the task list; it will be added, along with all its 
children, recursively. As an improvement over the traditional task planning 
template, the dashboard displays your task list in a hierarchical fashion. 
You can expand and contract this hierarchical view to get coarser- or 
finer-grained data. </p>

<h3>The relationship between the Hierarchy Editor and the Task &amp; Schedule 
tool</h3>

<p>It is also worth pointing out that if you edit your hierarchy in the 
future (using the <a href="UsingHierarchyEditor.html">hierarchy editor</a>), 
your changes will automatically propagate into affected task lists. For 
example, if you add a node named "Release 3.0" to a task list, then in the 
future if you were to create/delete subtasks underneath "Release 3.0", they 
would automatically appear in the task list / disappear from the task 
list.</p>

<p>Changes made in the hierarchy automatically get reflected into the 
schedule, because the schedule is basically a listing of the tasks/projects 
in the dashboard.  However, if you remove a task in the Task &amp; Schedule 
tool, it does <i>NOT</i> get removed from the task hierarchy of the process 
dashboard (as defined using the <a href="UsingHierarchyEditor">Hierarchy 
Editor</a>).  All you will have done is removed the task from the schedule, 
not deleted it entirely from the dashboard.  Deletion of tasks or projects 
from the dashboard itself must be done from the <a 
href="UsingHierarchyEditor.html">Hierarchy Editor</a>.</p> 

<h3>Editing the task list</h3>

<p>Once you have added tasks to the task list, you can use the Remove
Task button to remove them.  If you remove a <U>top-level</U> task, it
will be removed from the task list entirely.  (Top-level tasks are the
tasks that you explicitly added using the Add Task button; in the task
list, they appear as immediate children of the root of the tree.)  If
you remove a <u>child</u> of a top-level task, it will be
&quot;pruned&quot; out of the task list hierarchy, along with all of
its children.  You can highlight any pruned task (including children
of a pruned task) and click the Restore Task button to add it back to
the task list.</p>

<p>The planned completion dates displayed in the task list are based
upon the order you plan to complete the tasks.  It is unlikely that
you plan to complete the tasks in the order they appear in the
hierarchy.  Therefore, there are two ways to indicate the planned
order of tasks.  First, you can change the relative order of top-level
tasks by highlighting them and using the Move Task Up/Down buttons.
For more fine-grained control, check the Flat View checkbox.  This
will replace the hierarchical view of the task list with a flat view
of the &quot;leaf&quot; tasks that have not yet been completed.  You
can then use the Move Task Up/Down buttons to reorder these tasks.
You should generally try to put the tasks in chronological order (the
first task in the list should be the one you plan to work on first,
and so on).</p>

<H2>Step 2: Estimate task time </H2>

<P>Once tasks are added to the task list, the dashboard will look up 
information like the planned time, actual time, etc. from the appropriate 
Project Plan Summary forms (if applicable), and display it in the 
appropriate boxes. You can click on any value with a yellow background and 
edit it, and the change will appear immediately on the associated Project 
Plan Summary form.  Similarly, if you edit one of these values on a Project 
Plan Summary form, the new value will automatically appear here in the task 
list.</P> 


<H2>Step 3: Estimate calendar time</H2>

<P>To generate a schedule, the dashboard needs to know how much time you plan 
to spend working on these tasks, and when you plan to spend it. This 
information is displayed in the bottom portion of the window. Each row in the 
table represents a time period. These time periods are consecutive; each time 
period begins when the previous time period ends.</P> 

<P>Think about how much time you have available to work on the tasks listed 
in your task list. Describe a time period by entering the dates it will start 
and stop, and in the "PT" (Planned Time) column enter the number of hours you 
think you can spend during that time period.</P> 

<P>Most of the time people have fairly predictable schedules - for example, 
you might say "I'm going to spend 20 hours a week on this until it gets 
done." Since this is the most common situation, the schedule will, by 
default, grow automatically to meet the demand. You don't have to manually 
add rows to your schedule until there are enough hours to cover the tasks - 
instead, the schedule template will automatically duplicate the final row in 
the table until there are enough hours. You can easily see where the 
automatic portion of the schedule starts because the automatic rows are 
displayed with a medium gray font. Thus, the black rows in the schedule 
template are rows that you have manually created/edited, and the gray rows 
are the ones which have been automatically added to meet the time 
requirements.</p>

<p><center><img src="../../Images/TaskScheduleTimes.png"></center></p>

<p><A NAME="shortSchedule"></A>You can disable this automatic schedule 
expansion simply by making the final manual row in your schedule contain zero 
planned hours.  The dashboard recognizes that infinite duplications of the 
"zero" row will not help you get any more hours, so it leaves the schedule 
short and assigns some of your tasks the planned completion date of 
"never".</p> 

<P>As in the task list, editable cells have a yellow background.  Since time 
periods are contiguous, editing the "To" value on one row will cause the 
"From" value on the following row to change accordingly.  Similarly, editing 
the "From" value on one row will cause the "To" value on the previous row to 
change. If you make changes to the last black row (which is used as a 
template and copied to make all the subsequent gray rows), all of the gray 
rows will be regenerated accordingly. If you edit a value in one of the gray 
rows, it (and all of the rows before it) will become "real", and the row in 
question will become the new "template row" upon which subsequent gray rows 
will be based.</P>

<P>If you need to extend the schedule past its optimal completion date, click 
the Add Row button to create a new row at the bottom of your schedule. The 
Insert Row button will split the currently selected time period into two 
separate rows, while the Delete Row will merge the currently selected time 
period with the one that follows it. Note that it isn't possible to delete 
an automatically generated row. If you want to to force your schedule to 
end early, you should do so by entering 0 planned hours for the final time 
period, as described <A HREF="#shortSchedule">above</A>.</P> 

<a name="progress"></a><H2>Step 4: Track your progress</H2>

<P>With the list of tasks and the calendar of available time in place, the 
dashboard will calculate planned completion dates for each task. As you work, 
you should:</P>

<UL>
 <LI>Accurately log time against tasks using the <A 
   HREF="../Execution/PlayPause.html">Play/Pause button</A> and the <A 
   HREF="../Execution/UsingTimeLogEditor.html">Time Log Editor</A>. Time 
   logged against tasks in your task list will appear in the Actual Time
   columns of the task list and schedule list.</LI>
 <LI>Mark tasks complete using the <A 
   HREF="../Execution/CompletionButton.html">Completion Checkbox</A>. When 
   tasks are marked complete, the completion date will appear in the task 
   list, and you will earn the planned value for that task.</LI>
</UL>

<P></a>While your project is in progress, you can click on the "Chart" button 
for access to earned value charts and numerical analyses:</P>

<p><center><img src="../../Images/TaskChartValue.png"></center></P>

<P><center><img src="../../Images/TaskChartStats.png"></center></p>

<P>If you prefer, you can view this information in HTML, and even export it 
Excel, by clicking the Report button.</p>

<H2>The Save Button</H2>

<p>If you edit the schedule or the list of tasks, you will need to click the 
Save button to save your changes. If you edit yellow-background values in the 
task list, however, those changes will be saved transparently; pressing the 
save button is not necessary.</p>

<H2>The Collaborate Button</H2>

<p>The Collaborate button provides access to the 
<a href="TaskScheduleCollaboration.html">task &amp; schedule collaboration
features</a> of the dashboard.

<HR>

<H2>Potential mistakes</H2>

<P>Be careful to avoid making the following mistakes when creating a 
schedule:</P>

<P><B>Duplicate tasks:</B> Nothing currently prevents you from adding the 
same task to your task list more than once. This could easily happen, for 
example, if you add a task to your task list, then add its parent as well.  
If you do this, the dashboard will dutifully create a schedule as if you were 
performing the task twice.</P>

<P><B>Conflicts between different schedules:</B> The dashboard lets you 
create multiple, independent schedules. It does not, however, offer any 
support for time management when multiple schedules are running concurrently. 
Nothing prevents you from creating twelve different concurrent schedules, and 
promising to spend 40 hours per week on each.  Also, nothing prevents you 
from adding one task to multiple different schedules.</P>

<P><B>Time estimates that don't add up:</B> The Planned Time (PT) column 
should always add up in a hierarchical manner; that is, the planned time for 
a parent node should always be equal to the sum of the planned times for all 
its children. This is almost always the case for the PSP processes that come 
with the dashboard. However, if you have <A 
HREF="EnteringData.html#unlock">unlocked</A> your data and overwritten 
calculations, times may no longer sum up correctly.  This problem can also
occur if you are using plain hierarchy "nodes" to describe tasks, and you
subdivide a node after estimating its time.  When this occurs, the 
task list will use the children's plan time for calculations rather than the 
parent's.  To correct this error, do one of the following:<ul>
<li>Edit the planned times for the children, so they agree with the planned
    time for the parent.
<li>Edit the planned time for the parent, so it agrees with the planned
    time for the children.
<li>Highlight the planned time for the parent, and delete it.
</ul></P>

<P><B>Missing time estimates:</b> Earned value forecasts and calculations
make heavy use of the the planned times for the tasks in your task list.
If you forget to estimate the planned time for a task in your task list,
these forecasts will be underestimated.</p>

<P>The dashboard automatically checks for <i>some</i> of these errors,
and displays an warning if they are found. If errors are present, they
will be highlighted with red text. If you hover the mouse over the red
text, a tool tip will provide a short description of the problem. For
a more complete explanation of the problem, click the red "Errors"
button that appears at the bottom of the task &amp; schedule window.
