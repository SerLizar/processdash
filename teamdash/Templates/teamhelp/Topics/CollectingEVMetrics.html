<h1>Collecting Earned Value Metrics (Team Member)</h1>

<p>As you perform the tasks in your project plan, you will find earned
value to be the most important means of gauging your progress.  Earned
value can tell you if you are ahead or behind schedule, whether work
is taking more or less time than expected, and even whether you are
projected to finish on time. To calculate earned value, the dashboard
needs to know the actual amount of time you spend on each task, as
well as the date each task is completed. The dashboard makes it easy
to collect this information.</p>

<p>The instructions below provide a quick introduction to several
commonly used dashboard features. For more information, view the
dashboard's online user manual by choosing Help from the C menu.</p>


<ol>


<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>As you work, use the hierarchy menus on
the dashboard to designate the task you are currently performing.

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/team-indiv-example.png"></p>

<p>For convenience, you can choose to work through the tasks that have
been assigned to you for this project. Use the icon to the left of the
hierarchy menus to select the earned value task list you're using for
this team project. Then, the hierarchy menus will show you the tasks
you need to perform, listed in chronological order as they appear in
your task list. (To change the chronological order of these tasks, see
the discussion of &quot;Flat View&quot; in the &quot;Managing Your
Personal Earned Value Schedule&quot; section below.)</p></li>


<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>Use the Play/Pause button to start/stop
an internal timer. When you begin working, start the timer. When you
are interrupted or you stop for the day, stop the timer.

<p>There is a small down-arrow to the right of the play/pause
button. Clicking this down arrow will display a menu of tasks to which
you have logged time recently. You can make a selection from this list
to quickly resume a recently interrupted task.</p></li>


<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>If you make a mistake when logging time
(for example, if you forget to start or stop the timer), you can
correct the mistake with the Time Log Editor. To open the Time Log
Editor, choose Time Log from the C menu.</li>


<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>When you select a task that has a
dependency, an icon will appear to the right of the hierarchy
menus. The icons tell you whether the task depends upon other tasks,
whether those other tasks are completed, and much more information.
Place your mouse over the icon for more detailed information about
the dependency.  For more information about this feature, see the
<a href="/help/Topics/Planning/TaskScheduleDependencies.html">Task
Dependencies</a> help topic.</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>When you complete a task, mark it
complete by checking the box at the far right hand side of the
dashboard window. If you mark a task complete by mistake, you can
clear the checkbox to mark it incomplete.

<p>Checking the box will mark the current task complete as of the
current date and time. If a task was completed in the past but you
forgot to mark it complete, you can edit the completion date manually
in the task list of your earned value schedule.</p></li>
