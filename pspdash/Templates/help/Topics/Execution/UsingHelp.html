<H1>Using help</H1>

<P>This help system is a standard JavaHelp implementation.  Starting the help 
system is as easy as clicking "help" on the "C" (configure) menu.</p> 

<P>Currently the help system provides three ways of accessing help topics:</P>
<UL>
 <LI>A table of contents view</LI>
 <LI>An index view</LI>
 <LI>A search engine view</LI>
</UL>

<P>These three views are accessed via the three tabs at the top of the left 
screen pane.</P>

<h2>The Table of Contents view</h2>
<P>The table of contents provides a hierarchical organization of the help 
topics.  Items that are shown as books represent logical groupings of help 
topics and can be clicked to reveal more detailed help.</P>

<h2>The Index view</h2>
<P>The index view provides an alphabetical listing of various keywords on 
which to find help.</P>

<h2>The Search Engine view</h2>
<P>The search engine view provides an entry blank where you can enter 
words you would like the help system to search for within the help topics.  
After entering search criteria you will be presented with a list of help 
topics that contained the word or words entered.  To the left of each item 
will be a number indicating how many times the word(s) entered were found in 
that particular help topic.</P>

<h2>The navigation buttons</h2>
<P>The help viewer also provides two navigation buttons at the top left.  
They allow for the familiar "back" and "forward" functionalities that are so 
common in modern web browsers.</P>

<h2>The print buttons</h2>
<p>The two buttons to the right of the navigation buttons are a "Print Topic" 
button and a "Page Setup" button.  These buttons allow you to print a help 
topic for later reading.</p>

<h2>Context sensitive help</h2>
<P>There is also some context sensitive help available.  If you press the F1 
key while viewing the dashboard itself or one of its tools (PROBE, time log 
editor, etc.), the dashboard will startup a help screen pertinent to that 
tool.</p>
