<H1>Problem with Java Configuration</H1>

<P>We're sorry, but the Java Plug-in from Sun Microsystems is not
currently capable of supporting the dashboard's data integration
features.  Your browser appears to be configured to use this plug-in.

<P>To fix this problem, please visit the 
<a href="http://processdash.sourceforge.net/disable_plugin.html">Process
Dashboard website</a> for instructions.
