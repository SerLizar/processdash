<P>The PSP provides Postmortem scripts for all of the PSP levels.  To get to
the postmortem for the current program, we can click the link at the bottom of
the development script.  Alternatively, click the script button on the
dashboard and choose the option for the postmortem script.</p>

<P>After making sure that the postmortem entry criteria are met, the next step
is to enter the actual size data for the program.  You may find the
dashboard's <a href="../PostmortemAnalysis/LOCCounter.html">LOC counter</a>
useful for measuring added, deleted, and modified lines of code.  Enter the
actual values for base, deleted, modified, total, base additions, new, reused,
and total LOC on the Size Estimating Template form, which can be reached by
clicking the appropriate link from the postmortem script.</p>

<p class="ifpsp" align="center"><img src="../../Images/QSEnterActualLOC.png"></p>

<p>Some people do not care to enter detailed actual size data on the Size
Estimating Template.  Those numbers shown above can safely be skipped as long
as you faithfully enter summarized actual size data on the Project Plan
Summary:</p>

<p class="ifpsp" align="center"><img src="../../Images/QSEnterActualLOCPPS.png"></p>

<p>During postmortem, you should also review the numbers on the other pages of
the Project Plan Summary form.  If any numbers seem suspect, make appropriate
corrections in the <a href="../Execution/UsingTimeLogEditor.html">time</a> and
<a href="../Execution/UsingDefectLogEditor.html">defect</a> log editors.</p>

<P class="ifpsp" align="center"><img src="../../Images/QSProjectPlanSummary.png"></p>

<P>Once the actual size information has been entered and other metrics have
been reviewed for correctness, we can mark the postmortem phase complete.  If
you have faithfully marked all of the PSP phases complete, the dashboard will
mark the project itself complete as well.  We can double check that it has
been marked by looking at the Project Completion checkbox on the Project Plan
Summary.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../../Images/QSCheckProjectComplete.png"></p>

<p>If you marked all of the phases complete, but the Project Complete checkbox
still is not checked, this would indicate that you had already overridden this
automatic behavior.  You can learn more about the relationship between marking
the phases complete and marking the entire project complete by reading the <a
href="../Execution/CompletionButton.html">Using the completion checkbox</a>
help topic.</p>

<P>The Process Dashboard also offers several other aids for analyzing
postmortem data.  Choosing PSP Data Analysis from the
<img src="../../Images/cmenu.png"> menu will open the
web browser to a set of pages that contain many useful graphs of process
data.</P>

<p align="center"><img src="../../Images/DataAnalysisScreen.png"></p>

<P>This Data Analysis page provides several different categories of charts to 
allow easy analysis of various metrics measured in the PSP.  Clicking on one 
of the chart thumbnails in the right pane will bring up a full-sized view of 
that chart.  For more information on the types of data that can be analyzed 
via these reports and graphs, see the <a 
href="../PostmortemAnalysis/DataChartsAndReports.html">Creating Reports and 
Charts</a> help topic.</p>

<P>That's it for this example.  We hope it has been helpful.</p>
