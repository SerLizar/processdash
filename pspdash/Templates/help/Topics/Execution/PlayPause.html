<H1>Using the play/pause button</H1>

<P>The play/pause button gives access to the timer that is built into the 
dashboard.</P>

<img src="../../Images/ShowPlayPauseButton.jpg">

<P>By using the dashboard timer, you can measure the amount of time spent in 
the various phases of your development process.</P>

<P>By default, the play/pause button shows a triangle when the timer <em>IS 
NOT</em> running.  The intent is that the picture shows what will happen when 
it is pressed (pressing the play button will cause the timer to start).  Once 
pressed, the button image changes from the triangle to a pair of vertical 
bars.  When the vertical bars are displayed, the timer <em>IS</em> running.  
Again, the intent is to show what will happen when the button is pressed at 
this point (pressing the pause button will cause the timer to pause).</P>

</TABLE></P>

<P>If you would prefer to see the triangle when the timer <em>IS</em> 
currently running (i.e. you would rather see the current state of the timer 
on the button), you can override this default behavior by adding an entry to 
the configuration file.  Adding the following line to the configuration file 
will cause the play and pause symbols to reverse their meaning:</P>

<pre>pauseButton.showCurrent=true</pre>

<P>The configuration file is named "pspdash.ini" on Windows platforms, and 
".pspdash" on all other platforms.  It is located in either the user's home 
directory (default) or in the same directory as the pspdash.jar file.  For 
more information about the configuration file see the <a 
href="../AdvancedTopics/ConfigurationFile.html">configuration file</a> help 
topic.</P>
