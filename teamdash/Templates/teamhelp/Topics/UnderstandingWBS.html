<h1>Understanding the Role of the Work Breakdown Structure</h1>

<p>Stepping back from the details for a moment, it is very important
to understand the relationship between the Work Breakdown Structure
and the rest of your team project.</p>

<p>As any TSP practitioner knows, the project launch meetings used in
the Team Software Process are <i>very</i> intense planning
sessions. This allows them to produce extremely powerful team plans;
but since your entire team is present, these meetings are relatively
expensive from a business standpoint. Recognizing this, the Process
Dashboard team wanted to provide the best possible tool support to
facilitate these meetings. The WBS Editor is specifically designed to
meet this need. Everything about its design and user interface is
streamlined to facilitate the unique planning needs of a project
launch - enabling you to create the highest-quality team plan, while
minimizing the time required and eliminating frustrations whenever
possible.</p>

<p>For example, the contents of the WBS are edited
&quot;offline,&quot; in a mode that is completely disconnected with
the data in regular dashboard datasets. This offline approach allows
dramatic changes to be made to the hierarchy of the WBS quickly,
without waiting for those changes to be applied to an entire database
of existing project metrics.</p>

<p>The tradeoff, of course, is that individuals must occasionally use
the &quot;Sync to WBS&quot; buttons to copy project planning metrics
to their personal dashboard. The &quot;Sync to WBS&quot; operation
searches for changes that have been made in the WBS, and copies those
changes into the personal plan.  In addition, when individuals make
changes to their personal plan, &quot;Sync to WBS&quot; will attempt
to copy those changes back as well.</p>

<p>However, it is important to realize that the individual plans are
the &quot;gold standard&quot; used to compute rolled up project
metrics and reports.  When you view the team earned value plan or the
team rollup plan summary, you are viewing data that has been rolled up
from the personal plans of each team member.  If the team member plans
are not in sync with the WBS, the rollup will reflect the data in the
team member plans - not the data in the WBS.</p>
