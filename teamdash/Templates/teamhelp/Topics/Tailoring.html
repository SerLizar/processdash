<h1>Tailoring the Process Dashboard for Your Organization</h1>

<p>Every organization is different, and high-maturity teams have
differing needs from their metrics support tools.  The Process
Dashboard strives to meet these needs by offering a high degree of
customizability to support different processes.</p>

<p>Still, not every organization needs extensive customizability. Many
organizations, for example, would be content to use the standardized
metrics collection framework and process forms historically described
by the Team Software Process<sup> (SM)</sup>. Unfortunately, TSP<sup>
(SM)</sup> licensing does not permit the distribution of such
materials as open source, so the open source Process Dashboard
distribution cannot include them.</p>

<p>In the future, if TSP materials can be licensed for distribution
with the Process Dashboard, such materials would be made available at
<u>http://www.tuma-solutions.com/</u></p>

Dashboard should plan for and set aside time to perform the process
customization steps (listed in the sections below) <u>before</u> they
need to use the dashboard in support of a particular team project.</td>
