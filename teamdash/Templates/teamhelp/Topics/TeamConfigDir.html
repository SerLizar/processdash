<h1>Create Team Configuration Directory (Team Leader)</h1>

<p>The team support add-on for the Process Dashboard currently uses a shared
network directory to facilitate team collaboration.  When a particular team
begins using the Team Dashboard for the first time, it will be necessary to
create a network directory for them to use.</p>

<p>This <i>team configuration directory</i> will contain important team
planning information, such as the list of all the project iterations the team
has performed.  In the typical configuration, this directory will also hold
exported snapshots of individual data, which the Team Dashboard will import
and use to compute team roll-ups.</p>

<p>This team configuration directory must be accessible, readable, and
writable by all team members.  Because of this, it should generally be a
shared network directory. Since the directory will typically hold PSP data
collected by individuals, you may wish to configure it with permissions that
forbid file access by non-team members.</p>

<p>If you have several subteams that will be working together closely, and
those subteams need to roll up their data into a single set of reports, you
should create a single directory that all of these subteams will share.  If
you have multiple teams that are not closely related and who will not be
viewing consolidated reports, those teams should each have their own
directory.</p>

<p>If your team is performing several projects (or project iterations) one
after another, you should use a single team configuration directory for all of
the iterations.</p>

<p>Some projects will already have a shared network directory that is
used to hold project documents. If this is true for your project,
simply create a subdirectory for dashboard metrics data.  If your
project does not already have a shared project directory, work with
your information technology (IT) support staff to create one.</p>

<p><a name="criteria"></a>For this directory, it is <b><u>critical</u></b> to
ensure that the following file permissions are in place:</p>

<ul>

<li>All team members must be able to read/write all files</li>

<li>Permissions must be set to "inherit" - so that when new files and
subdirectories are created, all team members can read/write them as
well.</li>

</ul>

<p>If the members of your team are predominately using the Microsoft
Windows operating system, the use of a UNC path is strongly
recommended for configuration purposes.  That is, whenever the
dashboard asks for the location of this directory, you are encouraged
to enter the directory path as <tt>\\serverName\path\to\directory</tt>
instead of <tt>T:\path\to\directory</tt>.</p>

<p>Also, the Team Dashboard must be able to read and write directly to the
files in this directory.  <b style="color: a00">Do not</b> make use of
"Offline Folders," "Windows Sync," "Dropbox," "Google Drive," or any other
similar utilities which create a shadow copy of the files out on the network.
Use of those utilities will introduce a <b style="color: a00">high probability
of catastrophic loss</b> of Team Dashboard data.</p>

<p>There will be times in the future that you will need to recall the
location of the team configuration directory (for example, if a new
individual needs to install a Team Dashboard shortcut).  If you forget this
location, you can look it up by opening the Team Dashboard, choosing
Help&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;About Process Dashboard, and clicking the Configuration
tab.  The first paragraph on the Configuration tab will provide the location
of the team configuration directory.</p>
