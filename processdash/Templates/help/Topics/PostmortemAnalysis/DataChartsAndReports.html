<P>The Process Dashboard automates many reports and charts that can be quite 
useful in a project postmortem.</p>

<h2>The Project Plan Summary</h2>
<P>The main report that contains the most useful postmortem information for 
your project will probably be the Project Plan Summary form.  The Project 
Plan Summary can generally be produced by navigating to the project for which 
you would like the report, clicking the drop down list to the right of the
scripts button, and selecting the option for the Project Summary form.</p>

<h2>Marking your project complete</h2>
<P>It is important to mark your project as complete.  This lets the dashboard
know that you are finished with the project, and it can use the project data to
calculate the various items in the reports and charts.  You can edit the
project completion date via the appropriate field on the Project Plan Summary.
If you haven't edited the project completion date field on the Project Plan
Summary, marking all the phases in the project complete will mark the project
complete as well.</p>

<h2>The Time Log and Defect Log</h2>
<P>HTML versions of the Time Log and the Defect Log are also available from 
the scripts button.  If you navigate to the main Process script for any of 
the PSP processes (usually by following a link marked "top" near the bottom 
of the various reports and forms), you will links named "Time Log" and 
"Defect Log" in the text of the script.  These will bring up a read-only 
version of the two logs.</p>

<a name="charts"></a><h2>Graphical charts</h2>
<P>The dashboard also makes many graphical charts of various kinds 
available.  Choosing Data Analysis from the C menu will bring up a split view 
that contains an index of various chart types on the left and thumbnails of 
the charts available on the right.  Clicking any of the thumbnail charts will 
bring up a full-sized version of the chart.  When viewing a full-sized chart,
resizing your browser window will cause the chart to resize as well.  Finally,
clicking on a full-sized chart will display a table of the data used to draw
that chart.</p>

<p>The dashboard provides charts that allow</p>

<UL>
 <LI>Defect analysis - rates of injection and removal of defects in the 
   different process phases, defect injection and removal percentages in the 
   different process phases, and pie charts showing the distribution of defect 
   types.</LI>
 <LI>Plan analysis - comparisons of planned time and size with actual planned 
   time and size, planning error of both time and size, and breakdowns of the 
   amount of time spent in the different development phases.</LI> 
 <LI>Process analysis - comparisons of productivity rates, defect removal 
   yields, and appraisal to failure cost ratios.</li>
 <LI>Quality analysis - various looks at the quality metrics of defect 
   removal yield, failure and appraisal cost of quality, and LOC reviewed per 
   hour rates.</LI>
 <LI>R3 - the R3 report as called for in a PSP class.</li>
 <LI>R4 - the R4 report as called for in a PSP class.</li>
