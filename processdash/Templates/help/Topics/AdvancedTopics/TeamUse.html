<H1>Team Use</H1>

The Process Dashboard includes extensive functionality which can be used by
high-maturity project teams.  This functionality will be most useful and
intuitive to projects that are applying the Team Software
Process<sup>(SM)</sup>.  However, since the dashboard's team functionality is
general-purpose, it can be used effectively by non-TSP<sup>(SM)</sup> and
non-software teams.<a name="teamUsersManual"></a></p>

<p><table border cellpadding=5><tr><td bgcolor="#ffc0c0">The information below
provides a <u>very</u> abbreviated, high-level overview of the team
functionality in the dashboard.  A more thorough, step-by-step manual is
available; please visit <u
class="url">http://www.tuma-solutions.com/</u></td></tr></table></p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Before you begin, it is helpful to the dashboard's approach to team
support.  In this approach, each team member runs their own personal
instance of the dashboard, which they use to capture and track their own
personal metrics.  In addition, a team instance of the dashboard is run.
This team instance aggregates team data, calculates rolled-up metrics, and
displays charts and reports of team project data.</p>

<p><center><img src="../../Images/TeamRollupDataFlow.png"></center></p>

<p>To simplify ongoing communication, the dashboard uses a shared network
directory (labeled &quot;Team Data Directory&quot; in the diagram above).
Data is exported by personal dashboard instances into this network folder,
and imported by the team dashboard instance.  The resulting imported data
is then rolled up using existing mechanisms already present in the Process
Dashboard.</p>

<!--
<p>To use the Process Dashboard on a team project, follow the steps
below.</p>

<h2>Setup and Preparation</h2>

<p>To prepare for a team project, take the steps below.  It is recommended
that you perform these steps <b>before</b> your project launch planning
meeting.</p>

<h3>Install the Process Dashboard</h3>

<p>Each individual on the team will need to install the Process Dashboard.
When installing, the team leader should choose to install the &quot;Tools
for Team Leaders&quot; component.  On Windows systems, when you select this
optional component, the installer will create a second shortcut for
launching the &quot;Team Dashboard&quot; instance.</p>

<h3>Create Team Data Directory</h3>

Most teams have a folder on a shared network drive where project documents
are stored.  Create a subdirectory specifically for dashboard metrics data.
The main requirement is that all team members should have the ability to
save files to this directory.  In a Windows environment, each team member
will most likely want to map the network drive so the folder is accessible
via a simple filename.

<p>Depending on your organizational culture, you may also wish to tighten
permissions to prevent non-team members from viewing the data.</p>

<h3>Create Team Project</h3>

<p>The team leader should:<ul>

<li>Launch the &quot;Team Dashboard&quot; instance.</li>

<li>Open the Hierarchy Editor.  Use &quot;Edit <img border="0"
src="../../Images/rarrow.png" width="12" height="9"> Add Template <img
border="0" src="../../Images/rarrow.png" width="12" height="9"> Team
Project&quot; to create a team project.  Give the new team project an
appropriate name.  Then, save these changes and close the hierarchy
editor.</li>

<li>Use the hierarchy menus to navigate to the team project that was just
created.  Click the script button.  A Team Project Setup Wizard will be
displayed in your web browser.  Follow the instructions in the wizard to
set up the team project.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Invite Individuals to Join Team Project</h3>

<p>After creating the team project and completing the Team Project Setup
Wizard, the team leader should use the script button to open the &quot;Team
Project Tools and Settings&quot; page.  Use the hyperlink near the bottom
of the page to invite individuals to join this team project.</p>

<p>Individuals should use the hyperlink they receive from the team leader
to join the team project.  (For this to succeed, the team leader must leave
the team dashboard running while individuals join the project.  If the team
leader's computer is protected by a personal firewall, they should ensure
that incoming connections on port 3000 are permitted.)</p>



<h2>Plan Project Work</h2>

<p>Project teams using the TSP typically perform a project launch planning
meeting.</p>

<h3>Enter List of Team Members</h3>

<p>Open the &quot;Team Project Tools and Settings&quot page, and click on
the Edit Team Member List button.  Enter a line for each team member.  The
initials entered here should match the initials each team member used when
they joined the team project.  Save these changes.</p>

<h3>Plan Project Work</h3>

<p>Open the &quot;Team Project Tools and Settings&quot page, and click on
the Edit Work Breakdown Structure button.  The Work Breakdown Structure
Editor will be displayed, allowing you to:<ul>

<li>describe the high-level components and documents you will create for
    your project, and estimate their size</li>

<li>enter the tasks you will perform to produce those components</li>

<li>estimate the time for each task, and assign the tasks to
    individuals</li>

<li>describe the dependencies between tasks</li>

</ul></p>

<p>The Work Breakdown Structure Editor is a very powerful tool for rapidly
developing detailed, balanced team project plans.  It contains many
advanced features that are not described here.  For more information on
these features, obtain the <a href="#teamUsersManual">Team Users
Manual</a>.</p>

<h3>Synchronize Work Breakdown Structure</h3>

<p>After making and saving changes to the work breakdown structure, it is
necessary to copy this planning data to the dashboard instances for the
team and for each individual.  This step is performed by pressing the
&quot;Sync Work Breakdown Structure&quot; button on the &quot;Team
Project Tools and Settings&quot; page.</p>

<h2>Running the Project</h2>

<p>During project execution, individuals should use the dashboard to log
time and defects against the tasks assigned to them.  When tasks are
finished, mark them complete using the completion checkbox.</p>

<p>Data is exported from individual dashboard instances on a daily basis,
then imported automatically by the team dashboard instance.  In the team
dashboard, the Rollup Plan Summary form can be built dynamically to include
the charts and reports of interest to the team;  these will display data
rolled up from individuals on the project.</p>
