<H1>PSP<sup>(SM)</sup> Scripts/Forms Not Installed</H1>

<p>PSP process definitions for use with the dashboard <b>are
available</b> at no cost, but regrettably, these process definitions must
be distributed as a separate download from the Process Dashboard. (This
change is effective beginning in version 1.6; for more information,
<a href="/help/Topics/Overview/Separation.html">click here</a>.)  You
have not yet downloaded and installed these process definitions, so the
PSP process scripts and forms are not available.</p>

<p>If you decide in the future that you would like to use these process
definitions, please <a href="/psp-lib/getPSPMaterials.htm">download</a>
and install the PSP package(s).</p>

<p><font size="-2">PSP<sup>(SM)</sup> is a registered service mark of
Carnegie Mellon University.  The open source team that writes the
Process Dashboard is not affiliated with Carnegie Mellon
University.</font></p>
