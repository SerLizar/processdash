<h1>Earned Value Date Calculations</h1>

<p>Earned value is a powerful technique for planning and tracking your work.
To get the most value out of the earned value tools in the dashboard, it is
helpful to understand how the calculations are performed.  The paragraphs below
shed light on how various dates are calculated.</p>

<h2><a name="planDate"></a>Plan Date</h2>

<p>When you create a Task &amp; Schedule plan to describe your personal work,
the dashboard will automatically calculate the date when each task is planned
to complete.  This is a very simple calculation, and is specified in the PSP
book by Watts Humphrey.</p>

<p>Specifically, the Process Dashboard begins by making a list of the "leaf"
nodes in your task list.  (A "leaf" node is a task that does not have any
children underneath.)  The dashboard looks up the amount of time that you have
planned for each task.  Then, it uses the 
<a href="TaskScheduleSteps.html#flatView">flat view</a> of your task list to
determine the approximate order that you plan to perform the work.  The
resulting list might look something like this:</p>

<table border>
<tr><th>Task Name</th><th>Planned Time</th></tr>
<tr><td>Task A</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Task B</td><td>5</td></tr>
<tr><td>Task C</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>Task D</td><td>8</td></tr>
<tr><td>Task E</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr><td>Task F</td><td>7</td></tr>
<tr><td>Task G</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Task H</td><td>5</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Next, the dashboard will calculate a running total of the numbers in the
Planned Time column:</p>

<table border>
<tr><th>Task Name</th><th>Planned Time</th><th>Cumulative Planned Time</th></tr>
<tr><td>Task A</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Task B</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr>
<tr><td>Task C</td><td>3</td><td>9</td></tr>
<tr><td>Task D</td><td>8</td><td>17</td></tr>
<tr><td>Task E</td><td>4</td><td>21</td></tr>
<tr><td>Task F</td><td>7</td><td>28</td></tr>
<tr><td>Task G</td><td>2</td><td>30</td></tr>
<tr><td>Task H</td><td>5</td><td>35</td></tr>
</table>

<p>In addition, your task and schedule plan will include a calendar of time
that you plan to spend on the tasks in this task list.  That calendar might
look something like this:</p>

<table border>
<tr><th>Calendar Date</th><th>Planned Time</th></tr>
<tr><td>Week 1</td><td>6</td></tr>
<tr><td>Week 2</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Week 3</td><td>6</td></tr>
<tr><td>Week 4</td><td>6</td></tr>
<tr><td>Week 5</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Week 6</td><td>6</td></tr>
<tr><td>Week 7</td><td>6</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Just as before, the dashboard will calculate a running total of the numbers
in the Planned Time column of your schedule.  If the schedule does not contain
enough total hours to cover the tasks in your plan, the final row of the
schedule will be repeated until enough hours are available:</p>

<table border>
<tr><th>Calendar Date</th><th>Planned Time</th><th>Cumulative Planned Time</th></tr>
<tr><td>Week 1</td><td>6</td><td>6</td></tr>
<tr><td>Week 2</td><td>1</td><td>7</td></tr>
<tr><td>Week 3</td><td>6</td><td>13</td></tr>
<tr><td>Week 4</td><td>6</td><td>19</td></tr>
<tr><td>Week 5</td><td>0</td><td>19</td></tr>
<tr><td>Week 6</td><td>6</td><td>25</td></tr>
<tr><td>Week 7</td><td>6</td><td>31</td></tr>
<tr><td>Week 8</td><td>6</td><td>37</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Finally, the dashboard will cross-reference the numbers in these two
"Cumulative Planned Time" columns.  For example, if you were to work on the
tasks in the exact order that they appear in the task list, you would finish
Task A and Task B after completing 6 hours of work.  If you spend exactly as
much time per week as you plan to, you will finish 6 hours of work during Week
1.  So Task A and Task B would be completed on Week 1.  Task C would be
completed when you reach the 9 hour point, and that would occur sometime in the
middle of Week 3; so Task C would have a planned completion date of Week 3.
If we were to finish these cross-references, we would obtain the following
planned dates for each task:</p>

<table border>
<tr><th>Task Name</th><th>Planned Time</th><th>Cumulative Planned Time</th><th>Planned Date</th></tr>
<tr><td>Task A</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>Week 1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Task B</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>Week 1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Task C</td><td>3</td><td>9</td><td>Week 3</td></tr>
<tr><td>Task D</td><td>8</td><td>17</td><td>Week 4</td></tr>
<tr><td>Task E</td><td>4</td><td>21</td><td>Week 6</td></tr>
<tr><td>Task F</td><td>7</td><td>28</td><td>Week 7</td></tr>
<tr><td>Task G</td><td>2</td><td>30</td><td>Week 7</td></tr>
<tr><td>Task H</td><td>5</td><td>35</td><td>Week 8</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Once these values have been calculated for the "leaf" tasks in your plan,
the dashboard then takes a look at the other nodes in your hierarchically
organized task list.  Each parent node is planned to complete when its last
child finishes.  (The same technique is used to calculate the team rollup: each
node in the team rollup will be planned to finish on the date when the last
team member plans to finish that item.)</p>

<p>So that explains how the values in the "Plan Date" column are calculated.
From this explanation, you can make the following important observations:</p>

<ul>

<li>The planned dates are an idealized notion of the date when each task could
finish, if everything goes exactly according to plan.</li>

<li>Calculations are based solely on the planned times for each task and each
calendar period.  The actual time you spend has no effect on the values in the
Plan Date column.  (For that, see the description of the
<a href="#replanDate">Replan</a> column below.)</li>

<li>The Flat View ordering is a very important part of the calculation.  If you
want to obtain useful information for the dates when various tasks might
complete, you must periodically visit the flat view and update the task order
based on the work you plan to do next.  (However, if you neglect to do this,
the dashboard will still detect when you mark tasks complete, and will
automatically rearrange the completed tasks to the top of your "flat view"
ordering.)</li>

<li><a name="planRoundOff"></a>In your schedule, each calendar period has a
start date and an end date (as specified in the "From" and "To" columns of the
schedule).  When calculating the Plan Date for each task, the dashboard simply
reads the date in the "To" column of the schedule row when the task is
projected to finish.  On a typical project, this means that the Plan Dates will
be rounded off to the end of the following week.  Although useful information
is discarded by this rounding process, it is unfortunately necessary to ensure
that the planned dates remain faithful to the formulas specified by the PSP
process.</li>

</ul>



<h2><a name="replanDate"></a>Replan Date</h2>

<p>As discussed above, the <a href="#planDate">Plan Date</a> column provides an
idealized projection for when each task could be completed.  But of course,
work rarely goes exactly according to plan.  So the Replan Date column produces
an improved projection that takes into account the amount of time your schedule
has slipped.</p>

<p>Specifically, the dashboard will look at your original list of tasks, and
will estimate how much planned work is still remaining.  To do this, it will
make a temporary "working" copy of the original task list.  If any tasks have
already been marked complete, those completed tasks will be removed from the
"working" copy.  And if you have started logging time to other tasks in your
plan, the actual time you've spent so far will be subtracted from the
originally planned time, to calculate the amount of time that is remaining for
each task:</p>

<table border>
<tr><th>Task Name</th><th>Planned Time</th><th>Actual Time</th>
    <th>Completed?</th><th>Planned Time Remaining</th></tr>

<tr><td><strike>Task A</strike></td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>Y</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><strike>Task B</strike></td><td>5</td><td>7</td><td>Y</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Task C</td><td>3</td><td></td><td></td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>Task D</td><td>8</td><td>3</td><td></td><td>5</td></tr>
<tr><td>Task E</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>Task F</td><td>7</td><td></td><td></td><td>7</td></tr>
<tr><td>Task G</td><td>2</td><td></td><td></td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Task H</td><td>5</td><td></td><td></td><td>5</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Similarly, the dashboard will take a look at your original calendar of
available time, and will determine how much planned time is still remaining.
Just as before, this is accomplished by making a temporary "working" copy of
the original schedule.  Any calendar periods that have already passed are
removed from the working copy.  For the calendar period that is currently in
progress, the planned time will be prorated based on the percentage of real
time that has already elapsed.  The table below shows an example of what the
"working" calendar might look like if we are halfway through Week 4 of the
original schedule:</p>


<table border>
<tr><th>Calendar Date</th><th>Planned Time</th><th>In the Past?</th><th>Planned Time Remaining</th></tr>
<tr><td>Week 1</td><td>6</td><td>Y</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Week 2</td><td>1</td><td>Y</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Week 3</td><td>6</td><td>Y</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Week 4</td><td>6</td><td>50%</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>Week 5</td><td>0</td><td></td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Week 6</td><td>6</td><td></td><td>6</td></tr>
<tr><td>Week 7</td><td>6</td><td></td><td>6</td></tr>
<tr><td>Week 8</td><td>6</td><td></td><td>6</td></tr>
</table>

<p>After making a "working" list of the remaining tasks, and a "working" list
of the time planned for future calendar periods, the dashboard now takes these
two "working" lists and repeats the calculation that was originally performed
to compute planned dates.</p>

<p>Based on this explanation, the following observations about "Replan Date"
are worth noting:</p>

<ul>

<li>The Replan Date effectively calculates what the plan would look like if we
were to stop at the current instant in time and create a new plan for the
remaining work.</li>

<li>The Replan column assumes that the originally planned times will hold true
for all of the remaining tasks in the plan, and for all of the remaining
periods in the schedule.  As such, it is assuming that you had some unforeseen
bumps in the road, but that the remaining work will proceed exactly according
to the original plan.</li>

<li>In a simplified sense, the Replan column can be envisioned as having
measured the current schedule slip, and adding that difference to each planned
date.  But in reality the calculation is much more sophisticated, because it
accounts for (a) tasks in progress, and (b) variations in the amount of time
you plan to spend per calendar period.</li>

<li>The replan calculation takes the current date and time into account when it
calculates how much time is remaining in the current calendar period.  As a
result, the replan dates in your personal plan are being recalculated
continually, every second of every day.</li>
 
<li>If a task has been marked complete, the Replan column will show the actual
date the task was completed.</li>

<li><a href="#planRoundOff">As mentioned above</a>, the Plan Date calculation
is rounded off to the nearest week to maintain fidelity to the formulas in the
original PSP process.  However, since the Replan date is a calculation invented
by the Process Dashboard, there is no need to discard precision in this manner.
So when cross-referencing the cumulative planned times between the task list
and the schedule list, the dashboard will extrapolate into the middle of a
calendar period to calculate a more specific date.  (Please note that this is a
simple linear extrapolation.  It does not take working hours into account, so
replan dates may fall on weekends or holidays.  Like any other EV projection,
these dates are only intended to facilitate tracking and coordination; it would
be an error in planning judgement to interpret them literally.)</li>

<li>Sometimes your team may hold project relaunch meetings where you perform a
"replan."  However, it is just a coincidence that this column has a similar
name.  The "Replan" column is <b>not</b> displaying a snapshot of data produced
during your team relaunch.  If you want to retain a snapshot of a team plan, you
should save a baseline.</li>

</ul>



<h2><a name="forecastDate"></a>Forecast Date</h2>

<p>As discussed above, the <a href="#replanDate">Replan Date</a> column
observes that your schedule has slipped somewhat, then calculates the dates
each task might complete based on an assumption that the remaining work will
proceed exactly according to plan.  However, if your original plan contained an
estimating bias, that assumption will be incorrect. So the Forecast column
takes additional steps to adjust for estimating bias.</p>

<p>First, it looks at all of the tasks you have completed so far, and compares
the total planned time for those tasks to the total actual time that was spent.
It uses this ratio to compute your estimating bias for the tasks in this task
list.  Then, it assumes that the remaining tasks in your plan will also have
this same bias.</p>

<p>For example, in the table shown below, Task&nbsp;A and Task&nbsp;B have
been marked complete. Those two tasks had a combined planned time of 6 hours
(1&nbsp;+&nbsp;5), and a combined actual time of 9 hours (2&nbsp;+&nbsp;7). 9
divided by 6 is 1.5, indicating that tasks are taking 50% longer than expected
on average.  So the dashboard would multiply all of the original planned times
in this "working" task list by 1.5:</p>

<table border>
<tr><th>Task Name</th><th>Planned Time</th><th>Adjusted Plan Time</th>
    <th>Actual Time</th><th>Completed?</th><th>Planned Time Remaining</th></tr>

<tr><td><strike>Task A</strike></td><td>1</td><td></td><td>2</td><td>Y</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><strike>Task B</strike></td><td>5</td><td></td><td>7</td><td>Y</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Task C</td><td>3</td><td>4.5</td><td></td><td></td><td>4.5</td></tr>
<tr><td>Task D</td><td>8</td><td>12</td><td>3</td><td></td><td>9</td></tr>
<tr><td>Task E</td><td>4</td><td>6</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>5</td></tr>
<tr><td>Task F</td><td>7</td><td>10.5</td><td></td><td></td><td>10.5</td></tr>
<tr><td>Task G</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td></td><td></td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>Task H</td><td>5</td><td>7.5</td><td></td><td></td><td>7.5</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Similarly, the dashboard would examine the portion of the schedule that is
in the past.  It would add up the total planned time and the total actual time
for those past periods, and compute the ratio between these totals.  That ratio
would indicate whether you over- or underestimated the amount of time you would
be able to spend each week.  Then, it would make a "working" copy of the
schedule, and adjust the planned times for all of the future periods by that
ratio.</p>

<p>After having made these corrections to adjust for estimating bias in the
task list and the schedule, the calculation would proceed in the same manner as
the Replan calculation described above.</p>

<p>Based on this explanation, the following observations about "Forecast Date"
are worth noting:</p>

<ul>

<li>If your plan was reasonably accurate, the Forecast date can be a powerful
tool for automatically measuring and correcting the estimating biases in your
plan.</li>

<li>The forecast date examines completed tasks to calculate estimating bias.
However, you may only complete a few tasks during the first week or two of a
project.  During this time, the dashboard will not have much data to use for
its bias calculation, so the forecast date may swing wildly each time you mark
a task complete.  As a result, the Forecast date should be viewed with caution
until you have collected a few weeks worth of data.  During those first few
weeks of a project, the Replan date may be more useful for tracking
purposes.</li>

<li>The forecast calculation is based upon an assumption that future work will
have the same estimating bias as completed work.  If you have reason to doubt
that assumption, use the Forecast date with caution.  For example, if your
original plan was extremely poor, and there is no good relationship between the
planned and actual times of the tasks in your plan, then the forecast date may
not be meaningful.</li>

<li>Since the forecast date looks at completed work to measure the estimating
bias, a forecast date cannot be calculated until you have marked at least one
task complete.</li>

<li>At the team level, the Forecast Date is computed by identifying the
chronologically latest forecast date for all of the individual members of the
team.  As a result, if any single team member does not have a forecast date
(because they have not yet marked a task complete), then the team rollup will
not have a forecast date either.</li>

<li>To allow for the most accurate calculation of estimating bias, you should
strive to log your task time faithfully.  For example, if you routinely forget
to log time against your tasks, and then just mark tasks complete with zero
time logged, the bias calculation and resulting forecast date will be
inaccurate.</li>

</ul>


<h2><a name="optForecastDate"></a>Optimized Forecast Date</h2>

<p>The discussions above describe how dates are calculated in the earned value
plan for a single individual.  Then, the dashboard rolls these dates up to the
team level by identifying the date when all team members will finish.  As a
result, when you see the green "Forecast" line on a team earned value chart, it
is depicting the date when the <b>last</b> team member is projected to
finish.</p>

<p>Of course, a high-maturity team will monitor the forecast dates for each
team member to see whether there is a large discrepancy between the dates when
the first and last team members will finish.  When a large discrepancy is
present, the workload is said to be unbalanced.  In that scenario, it is
helpful to identify the date when the team could finish if the workload were
optimally rebalanced.</p>

<p>The dashboard calculates this Optimized Forecast Date in the following
way:</p>

<ul>

<li>The Forecast algorithm above is used to create a bias-adjusted "working"
task list, and a bias-adjusted "working" schedule for each team member.</li>

<li>Then, a consolidated task list is created, and the dashboard identifies the
number of hours of remaining work that is forecast for the entire team.</li>

<li>Additionally, the "working" schedules are summed up to produce a single
consolidated schedule, showing the number of hours that the entire team is
forecast to have available during each week in the future.</li>

<li>Finally, the remaining hours in the task list are cross-referenced against
the forecast hours in the consolidated team schedule.  The resulting "optimized
forecast date" is the date that the work would finish if the work was balanced
perfectly.</li>

</ul>

<p>This is a very sophisticated calculation.  In particular, it is performing
independent bias adjustments for each individual team member, based on the
actual task and schedule data they have collected so far.  And it is taking
into account variations in staffing levels - for example, the dates when
individual team members will be out of the office, and dates when particular
individuals <a href="TaskScheduleSteps.html#shortSchedule">will leave the team
project</a>.</p>

<p>The Optimized Forecast Date is displayed on the earned value charts as an
orange line.  When the orange line and the green line are far apart, this is a
warning sign that the workload is unbalanced.</p>
