<h1>The Task Note Indicator</h1>

<p>Notes and comments can be attached to any project or task in the
dashboard.  To create, view, or edit these notes, click the note indicator
icon near the right edge of the main dashboard toolbar.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/PointToNoteIndicator.png"></p>

<p>The Task Comment Editor window will appear.</p> 

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/NoteEditor.png"></p>

<p>This window displays your project/task hierarchy on the left.  Click a
particular project, component, or task to create, view, or edit the
associated note.  To delete a note, simply delete all the text in the note,
then save the changes.</p>

<p>When a note is associated with the currently active task (or any of its
hierarchical parents), the note indicator on the main dashboard toolbar
will turn yellow, and the tooltip will provide the text of the note.</p>

<p>If you attach a note to a component or task within a team project, that
note will be shared with other members of the team project when you perform
a "Sync to WBS" operation.</p>

<h2><a name="embedURL"></a>Linking to External Websites</h2>

<p>Most people make use of many websites as they work. Your organization may
have websites for tracking requirements, defects, and other issues.  And your
team may have websites for team collaboration.</p>

<p>These sites may include web pages that are relevant to a particular
project, component, or task in the dashboard.  You can easily link these
webpages to your tasks in the dashboard.  Just enter a note for a particular
dashboard task or component, and include a webpage URL in the body of the
note (as shown in the example above).  The dashboard will discover these
embedded URLs and automatically add them to the script button pull-down
menu.</p>

<P align="center"><img src="../../Images/ScriptPullDownWithCustomLink.png"></p>

<p>By default, the script button menu item will display the title of the
target web page.  If you want the menu item to display something else, just
include the desired title after the URL, and enclose the item with square
brackets <tt>[]</tt>.  (This can also be helpful if the website in question
requires a login that would prevent the dashboard from retrieving the page
title.)  For example:</p>
