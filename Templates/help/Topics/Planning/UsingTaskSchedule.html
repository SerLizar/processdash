<H1>Using the Task &amp; Schedule Tool</H1>

<P>The task and schedule tool allows you to generate a schedule for 
completing tasks, and track progress against that schedule using earned 
value. You can open the task and schedule tool by selecting the 
&quot;Task &amp; Schedule&quot; option on the
<a href="../Execution/ConfigureMenu.html">configuration menu</a>.</P>

<p>For more guidance in creating an earned value schedule, see the
<a href="TaskScheduleSteps.html">Creating a schedule step by step</a>
help topic.</p>

<P>If you haven't created any schedules, the dashboard will immediately
jump to the <a href="#createNew">Create New Schedule</a> dialog which will
allow you to create one.  If you have already created at least one
schedule, a Task &amp; Schedule chooser window will appear.</P>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/TaskScheduleChooser.png"></p>

<p>This window displays all the schedules you have created. After you click
on a schedule to highlight it, you can use the buttons along the bottom to
rename it, delete it, or open it for editing.  The Report button will show
you the detailed status for the schedule in your web browser.</p>

<p><a name="createNew"></a>Clicking the New button will create a new
schedule. The dashboard will ask you to enter a name for the new schedule.
This allows you to track different schedules from within the dashboard;
each schedule must have a unique name.</p>

<p id="evRollup" class="figure"><img src="../../Images/NewTaskSchedulePrompt.png"></p>

<p>In addition to choosing a schedule name, you can indicate whether you want
to create a regular schedule or an EV roll-up.</p>

<ul>

<li>A regular schedule is used to plan work and track progress against a
calendar.  This is the most commonly used option.</li>

<li>A roll-up schedule calculates a roll-up of data from two or more other
schedules.  If you are splitting your time between a number of different team
projects (each with its own schedule), you can create a rollup to view and
track your consolidated personal progress.</li>

</ul>

<p>When a new schedule is first created, an empty Task &amp; Schedule
window will appear prompting you for the first task you want to add to the
schedule.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/AddTaskToSchedule.png"></p>

<p>All the tasks that are to be tracked within the schedule must come from 
the project hierarchy defined using the 
<a href="UsingHierarchyEditor.html">Hierarchy Editor</a> or the 
<a href="../../../teamhelp/Topics/EditingTheWBS.html">Work Breakdown Structure
Editor</a>.  You can track progress against PSP projects, projects you have
made using custom process scripts or add-on process sets, or even against just
a hierarchy of task names that are not associated with a particular process in
the dashboard.  The Task &amp; Schedule tool is completely process
independent.</p>

<P>The Task &amp; Schedule window combines a project task list and a
simple project schedule into one window.  The top portion of the
window gives a view of the task schedule on a task by task basis and
tracks metrics about each task.  The bottom portion of the window is
concerned with actual calendar time.  The time for the schedule is
broken out into time periods (e.g. weeks) and the columns track
metrics about each time period.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/TaskSchedule.png"></p>

<p>Editable values appear with a yellow background. If you are unfamiliar 
with the various columns in the task and schedule planning templates, you can 
hover the pointer over the column headings and a tool tip will tell you what 
the abbreviated heading stands for.</p>

<p>If you edit the schedule or the list of tasks, you will need to click the 
Save button to save your changes. If you edit yellow-background values in the 
task list, however, those changes will be saved transparently; pressing the 
save button is not necessary.</p>

<h2>Columns in the Task List</h2>

<P>While this help topic won't get into all the details of earned value 
tracking, briefly here are the items that are shown in the upper window.
(<b>Note:</b> you can customize the columns that are displayed by choosing
"Select Task Columns" from the "View" menu.)</p>

<p><b>Planned Time (PT):</b> This is the amount of time you have
planned for the given task.  Generally this will be displayed in hours
and minutes.  However, if this field is editable, you can enter a
percentage instead of a duration to mark this task as a 
&quot;<a href="TaskScheduleSteps.html#loe">level of effort</a>&quot;
task.</p>

<p><b>Time</b> This is the actual amount of time spent on a given task.</p>

<p><b>Planned Value (PV):</b> This is the amount of earned value that will be 
earned by the given task based on the planned numbers.  It is calculated as
a percentage of the total planned work.</p>

<p><b>Plan Date:</b> This is the date the task is planned to complete. The
Task &amp; Schedule tool computes this by assuming that the planned time
for each task, the planned task order, and the planned hours per time
period will be 100% accurate.  Then, it determines when your schedule will
have enough planned hours to complete the first task, the second task, and
so on. (For more details on this calculation, 
<a href="TaskScheduleDates.html#planDate">click here</a>.)</p>

<p><b>Replan:</b> No plan is perfect.  When things don't go according
to plan, it is helpful to chart a new course ahead based on the most
up-to-date information.  The dashboard looks at the tasks you've
completed so far, the time you've spent on tasks in progress, and the
time you have available in your schedule.  Then, it recalculates
planned dates for each task by assuming assumes that your plan was
essentially correct, but has encountered a few "bumps" in the road.</p>

<p>As an oversimplification, you can think of this as calculating how
far ahead or behind schedule you are, and adding that delta to the
planned date for each task.  In reality, the calculation is more
intelligent, because it accounts for in-progress work, overspent
tasks, and variations in the amount of time your schedule contains per
period.  (For more details on this calculation, 
<a href="TaskScheduleDates.html#replanDate">click here</a>.)</p>

<p><b>Forecast:</b> This is the date that the Task &amp; Schedule tool
thinks you might actually finish the given task.  After you have completed
at least one task in your plan and at least one time period in your
schedule, the Task &amp; Schedule tool will compare your actual performance
to your planned performance.  (For example, are tasks taking twice as long
as expected?  Are you spending as much time per period as you thought you
would?)  Then, it assumes that these plan-to-actual relationships will hold
true for the rest of the tasks in your plan, and recomputes completion
dates accordingly.  (For more details on this calculation, 
<a href="TaskScheduleDates.html#forecastDate">click here</a>.)</p>

<p><b>Date:</b> This is the actual completion date.  It will be filled in
automatically when you mark the task complete via the <a
href="../Execution/CompletionButton.html">Completion
Button</a>. Alternately, you can edit completion dates here (for example,
if you need to back-date the completion of an item). If you need to mark
several tasks complete with the same date, use Ctrl-C to copy the date
in a given cell; then select a range of date cells and press Ctrl-V to
paste that date into all of them.</p>

<p><b>Milestone:</b> If milestones have been defined by a team project, this
column will appear to display the milestone each task is associated with.  If
a particular task is not projected to finish in time to meet the milestone
commitment date, the value in this column will turn red and a tooltip will
provide additional information.</p>

<p><b>Labels:</b> If labels have been defined in a team project, this column
will appear to show the labels associated with each task.</p>

<p><b>Notes:</b> This column displays a note icon for any task that has
an <a href="../Execution/NoteIndicator.html">associated note</a>. You can
place your mouse over the icon to read the note.  To create a new note or
edit an existing note, just click on a cell in this column.</p>

<p><b>Dep:</b> This column displays information about 
<a href="TaskScheduleDependencies.html">task dependencies</a>.
If a task has no dependencies, nothing will be displayed.  If the task
depends on at least one other task which has not yet been completed, a
"stop sign" icon will be displayed, indicating that work cannot proceed
until the predecessor has been completed.  Once all predecessors have been
marked complete, the icon will change to a green checkmark.</p>

<p>To edit the list of dependencies for a task, double-click on a cell in
this column, and follow the instructions.  Generally, this approach is
unnecessary, because most projects will choose to define dependencies at
the team level.  In that scenario, the dependency information will be
copied from the team plan automatically, and you won't need to edit the
information here.</p>

<p>This column will also display an icon for "reverse dependencies."  If
other individuals are waiting for you to complete a task, this column
will display an indicator to that effect.</p>

<p><b>Percent Complete (%C):</b> This is the percent complete for the
current task.  Many people are accustomed to informally estimating
percent complete; PSP formalizes this concept:<ul>

  <li>If a task has no subtasks, it will either be 0% complete or 100%
      complete, based upon whether you have marked it complete via the
      <a href="../Execution/CompletionButton.html">Completion Button</a>.</li>

  <li>If a task has subtasks, its percent complete is calculated by
      using the planned times of those tasks to compute a weighted
      average.</li>

</ul>At times you might wish for the ability to edit the "percent
complete" for a task because it is "90% done."  Unfortunately, this
often leads to tasks that reach 90% complete and stay there for weeks,
slipping the schedule.  PSP states that instead, you should break the
task down into subtasks and mark some of those subtasks complete.
That way, you will get an accurate measure of percent complete.</p>

<p><b>Percent Spent (%S):</b> This number describes the relationship
between planned time and actual time for the given task.  If you have
spent twice as much time on this task as you planned to spend, it
would be 200% spent.  If you have only used up half of the planned
time, the task would be 50% spent.</p>

<p><b>Earned Value (EV):</b> This is the actual amount of earned value that 
this task has earned.  <i>Remember that earned value measures are not counted 
until the task is marked as complete.</i></p>


<table border cellpadding="10px"><tr><td>

<b>Note:</b> The columns listed above are sufficient for most
simple planning.  As a result, the task list will usually only display
the columns listed above.  For advanced planning, however, some
additional information must also be displayed.  Therefore, the
following columns will automatically appear if: <ul>
<li>You manually prune subtasks out of your hierarchical task list
<li>You logged time to any of the tasks in your task list before
    the starting date of your schedule, and you have enabled the
    <a href="TaskScheduleSteps.html#iterativePlanning">iterative
    planning</a> schedule option.</li>
<li>You completed any of the tasks in your task list before the
    starting date of your schedule, and you have enabled the
    <a href="TaskScheduleSteps.html#iterativePlanning">iterative
    planning</a> schedule option.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><a name="PDT"></a><b>Planned Direct Time (PDT):</b> The
&quot;Planned Time&quot; column (described above) displays the
<u>total</u> amount of time you plan to spend on a task, no matter
when that time gets spent.  In contrast, the &quot;Planned Direct
Time&quot; column displays the amount of effort you plan to spend as
part of <u>this schedule</u>.</p>

<p>An example can help illustrate the difference.  Imagine that one of
the tasks on your task list is to write a large software module. It
might have subtasks for requirements, design, implementation, and
formal testing.  The total amount of time needed to complete all of
these subtasks would be displayed in the &quot;Planned Time&quot;
column.  Now suppose you already completed requirements and design,
and started on the implementation, as part of an earlier project
iteration.  Furthermore, you don't plan to begin formal testing until
the next project iteration.  The &quot;Planned Direct Time&quot; for
requirements, design, and formal testing would be zero, since you
don't intend to spend any time on them during the current project
phase.  Also, since you already performed some of the work for the
implementation task, only the remaining portion of its planned time
would appear in the &quot;Planned Direct Time&quot; column.</p>

<p>The &quot;Planned Direct Time&quot; column will only be displayed
if it differs from the &quot;Planned Time&quot; column for at least
one task in your task list.  When it appears, you will note that the
&quot;plan value&quot; for a task is based on its planned direct time,
not its planned time.</p>

<p><b>Actual Direct Time (DTime):</b> The &quot;Actual Time&quot;
column displays the <u>total</u> amount of time you have spend on a
task to date, no matter when that time was spent.  In contrast, the
&quot;Actual Direct Time&quot; column displays the amount of effort
you have spent as part of <u>this schedule</u>.</p>

<h2>Columns in the Schedule List</h2>

<p>Briefly, here are the items that are shown in the bottom window:</p>

<p><b>From:</b> This is the starting date for a portion of your work 
schedule.  The schedule can start anytime and can be of just about any length 
(one week in duration, one day, one month, etc.).</p>

<p><b>To:</b> This is the ending date for a portion of your work
schedule.  Using the From and To fields, you can break your schedule
up into managable time chunks.  The Task &amp; Schedule tool defaults
to using time periods of one week in length, but you can edit the To
field to create time periods of any length (e.g. months, days, or even
hours).</p>

<p><b>Planned Time (PT):</b> This is the amount of time that will be 
applied to the tasks in the task list during the calendar time period 
selected by the From and To fields.  It defaults to 20 hours, but can be set 
to whatever number you think is accurate for the amount of time you will 
actually spend on task <i>during the given time period</i>.  Note that this 
is the total amount of time you plan on spending on <i>ALL</i> of the tasks 
listed in the top window.  The default numbers on the Task &amp; Schedule 
tool work out to 20 hours per week of work on task.</p>

<p><b>Cumulative Planned Direct Time (CPT):</b> This is the Planned Direct 
Time of the given time period, plus the times of all previous periods.</p>

<p><b>Cumulative Planned Value (CPV):</b> This shows cumulatively the amount 
of earned value that is planned for the given time period.</p>

<p><b>Actual Time (Time):</b> This shows the actual amount of time
spent on the tasks in the schedule during the given time period.</p>

<p><b>Cumulative Actual Direct Time (CT):</b> This shows the actual amount of 
direct time spent on task during the given time period cumulatively.</p>

<p><b>Notes:</b> This column allows you to attach an annotation to a time
period in your schedule.  These notes could be used, for example, to record
the reason why a week has a different number of planned hours, or the reason
why actual hours differed from expectations.  A note icon is displayed for any
time period that has an annotation.  You can place your mouse over the icon to
read the note.  To create a new note or edit an existing note, just click on a
cell in this column.</p>

<p><b>Actual Cumulative Earned Value (EV):</b> This shows the amount of earned 
value actually earned during the given time period cumulatively.</p>

<table border cellpadding="10px"><tr><td>

<b>Note:</b> The columns listed above are sufficient for most
simple planning.  As a result, the schedule list will usually only
display the columns listed above.  However, if your task list contains
any &quot;level of effort&quot; tasks, then &quot;time&quot; and
&quot;direct time&quot; will no longer be the same.  As a result, the
following columns will automatically appear:</p>

<p><b>Planned Direct Time (PDT):</b> The first column, labeled
&quot;PT,&quot; will display the total amount of time you plan to
spend during this period on <i>ALL</i> tasks in the task list; this
column, however, will show how much time is available after
subtracting time for &quot;level of effort&quot; tasks.</p>

<p><b>Percent Indirect Time (%I):</b> This shows the percentage of your
total actual time that you spent on &quot;level of effort&quot; tasks.</p>

<p><b>Actual Direct Time (DTime):</b> The &quot;Time&quot; column will
display the total amount of time you actually spent on <i>ALL</i>
tasks in the task list.  This column, however, will subtract out time
spent on &quot;level of effort&quot; tasks to show how much time you
spent on tasks that earn value.</p>

</td></tr></table>

<H2>Potential mistakes</H2>

<P>Be careful to avoid making the following mistakes when creating a 
schedule:</P>

<P><B>Duplicate tasks:</B> Nothing currently prevents you from adding the 
same task to your task list more than once. This could easily happen, for 
example, if you add a task to your task list, then add its parent as well.  
If you do this, the dashboard will dutifully create a schedule as if you were 
performing the task twice.</P>

<P><B>Conflicts between different schedules:</B> The dashboard lets you create
multiple, independent schedules. It does not, however, prevent you from
overextending yourself when multiple schedules are running concurrently.
Nothing prevents you from creating twelve different concurrent schedules, and
promising to spend 40 hours per week on each.  If you are splitting your time
across a number of different projects, take the time to 
<a href="#evRollup">create an EV rollup</a> of your active projects.  In that
EV rollup, you can click on a cell in the PT column to manage your weekly time
commitments across the various projects.</p>

<P><B>Time estimates that don't add up:</B> The Planned Time (PT) column 
should always add up in a hierarchical manner; that is, the planned time for 
a parent node should always be equal to the sum of the planned times for all 
its children. This is almost always the case for the PSP processes that come 
with the dashboard. However, if you have
<A HREF="EnteringData.html#unlock">unlocked</A> your data and overwritten 
calculations, times may no longer sum up correctly.  This problem can also
occur if you are using plain hierarchy "nodes" to describe tasks, and you
subdivide a node after estimating its time.  When this occurs, the 
task list will use the children's plan time for calculations rather than the 
parent's.  To correct this error, do one of the following:<ul>
<li>Edit the planned times for the children, so they agree with the planned
    time for the parent.
<li>Edit the planned time for the parent, so it agrees with the planned
    time for the children.
<li>Highlight the planned time for the parent, and delete it.
</ul></P>

<P><B>Missing time estimates:</b> Earned value forecasts and calculations
make heavy use of the the planned times for the tasks in your task list.
If you forget to estimate the planned time for a task in your task list,
these forecasts will be underestimated.</p>

<P>The dashboard automatically checks for <i>some</i> of these errors,
and displays an warning if they are found. If errors are present, they
will be highlighted with red text. If you hover the mouse over the red
text, a tool tip will provide a short description of the problem. For
a more complete explanation of the problem, click the red "Errors"
button that appears at the bottom of the task &amp; schedule window.
