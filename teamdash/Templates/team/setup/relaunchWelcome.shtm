<p>When a team begins a new project iteration, they often hold a project
relaunch meeting.  During that meeting, they create a detailed plan for the
new iteration.</p>

<p>This Relaunch Wizard is designed to help you create a starting point for
the new iteration plan.  The relaunch wizard will:</p>

<ul>

<li>Mark the "<tt><!--#echo var=PATH_TRANSLATED --></tt>" project as
<b><u>closed</u></b>, indicating that no additional work will be performed
there.</li>

<li>Create a new Team Project to hold the plan for the new iteration.</li>

<li>Copy the workflows, milestones, and team member schedules from the old
plan to the new plan.</li>

<li>Copy incomplete components and tasks from the old plan to the new plan,
and adjust the planned times of in-progress tasks to account for work that
has already been performed.</li>

</ul>

<p>The Relaunch Wizard looks at the 
<a href="teamMetricsStatus?for=Corresponding_Project_Nodes">actual data
exported by team members</a> to determine which tasks are complete, and
which tasks should be moved to the new iteration plan.  Accordingly, it is
helpful if team members have exported their most up-to-date, accurate data
for the "<!--#echo var=PATH_TRANSLATED -->" project before you run the
Relaunch Wizard.</p>

<table class="warning"><tr>
<td><img src="warning.gif"></td>
<td>If your project relaunch meeting will not be occurring for several more
days, you <b>should not continue</b> with this wizard.  Continuing will
close the current project iteration, which may make it difficult for team
members to wrap up work on their final tasks.</td>
</tr></table>

<p>If you are currently holding a project relaunch meeting, or that meeting
is imminent, press the Next button to continue.</p>
