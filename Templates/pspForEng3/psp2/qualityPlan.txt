= Calculate the nominal number of defects we expect in this program.

[Estimated_Defect_Density] =
    lookup([Previous_Program] &/ "Defect Density To Date");
[Estimated_Defect_Count] = 
    [Estimated New & Changed KLOC] * [Estimated_Defect_Density];



= Next, tweak the planned data so it is editable for certain phases.

#define unlockEstimatedPhaseData(Phase)					      \
  [Phase/Estimated Time] = unlock(					      \
        [Estimated Time] *						      \
        lookup([Previous_Program] &/ "Phase/%/Time To Date"));		      \
  [Phase/Estimated Defects Injected] = unlock(				      \
        [Estimated_Defect_Count] *					      \
        lookup([Previous_Program] &/ "Phase/%/Defects Injected To Date"));    \
  [Phase/Estimated Defects Removed] = unlock(				      \
        [Estimated_Defect_Count] *					      \
        lookup([Previous_Program] &/ "Phase/%/Defects Removed To Date"));

unlockEstimatedPhaseData(Planning);
unlockEstimatedPhaseData(Design);
unlockEstimatedPhaseData(Design Review);
unlockEstimatedPhaseData(Code);
unlockEstimatedPhaseData(Code Review);
unlockEstimatedPhaseData(Compile);
unlockEstimatedPhaseData(Test);



= The "Before Development" and Postmortem phases must be handled
= specially.  We don't want to unlock them because they aren't relevant
= to the creation of a quality plan.  But we do need to reset the defect
= calculations, because they would otherwise be based upon calculations
= that we are about to redefine below.

[Before Development/Estimated Defects Injected] == 0;
[Postmortem/Estimated Defects Injected] == 0;
[Postmortem/Estimated Defects Removed] == 0;



= The user was allowed to arbitrarily edit the defects injected and
= removed, to include deciding that this program will have fewer total
= defects than past programs.  Recalculate the defect totals and
= densities based on their planned values.

[Estimated Defects Injected] =
    sumFor("Estimated Defects Injected", [Phase_List]);
[Estimated Defects Removed] =
    sumFor("Estimated Defects Removed", [Phase_List]);

[Estimated Defects per KLOC] =
    [Estimated Defects Removed] / [Estimated New & Changed KLOC];
[Estimated Defect Density] = [Estimated Defects per KLOC];



= The user was allowed to edit planned time in phase.  However, it is
= important for this to sum up to the total time they estimated using
= PROBE.  We will use a working assumption that quality activities will
= result in reduced Test time.  Accordingly, we will recalculate the
= estimated Test time to reflect the time that is left over after other
= phases are complete.

[Estimated_Non_Test_Time] = sumFor("Estimated Time",
           "Planning", "Design", "Design Review", "Code",
           "Code Review", "Compile", "Postmortem");

[Test/Estimated Time] = max(0, [Estimated Time] - [Estimated_Non_Test_Time]);

[Phase_Sum_Problem_Capable] = TAG;
[Phase_Sum_Problem] = abs([Estimated Time]
			  - [Estimated_Non_Test_Time]
			  - [Test/Estimated Time]) > 0.5;
