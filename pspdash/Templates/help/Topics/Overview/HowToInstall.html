<H1>How To Install</H1>

<H2>System Requirements</H2>
<P>The Process Dashboard is 100% Java, and will run on any system with a Java 
2 compliant virtual machine. This includes Windows, Linux, Unix,
and Macintosh systems. For access to forms and scripts, a web browser is also required.</p>

<P>To use the process dashboard, you must <b>first</b> install the following 
software:</P> 

<UL>
 <LI>The Java Runtime Environment, version 1.3 or greater (available from Sun 
   Microsystems at <u>http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/jre</u>)</li>

 <LI><STRONG><U>One</U></STRONG> of the following web browsers:
  <UL>
   <LI>Internet Explorer 4.0 or greater (available from Microsoft at 
      <u>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.htm</u>) If you choose 
      to perform a custom installation of IE, make certain to install the
      "Data Binding" option.</li>

   <LI>Netscape 4.7 (available from Netscape at 
      <u>http://home.netscape.com/download/archive.html</u>), or greater.
      On Windows systems, the dashboard can now integrate with Netscape 6
      and Netscape 7 (available from Netscape at
      <u>http://home.netscape.com/download</u>).</LI>

  </UL>

 <LI>Make certain that Java and JavaScript are enabled in your browser. (This 
   is typically the default setting, so you usually don't need to worry about 
   enabling these unless you explicitly disabled them in the past.)</li>

 <LI>If you connect to the internet via a proxy server, you may need to tell 
   your browser to bypass the proxy for the address "localhost". The 
   instructions below may not apply to your browser word-for-word, but should 
   hopefully get you pointed in the right direction:
  <UL>
   <LI>For Internet Explorer, choose &quot;Tools <IMG BORDER="0"
    SRC="../../Images/rarrow.png" WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="9"> Internet 
      Options&quot;. Click on the "Connections" tab, then on the "LAN
      Settings" button. Make certain the "Bypass proxy server for
      local addresses" box is <B><STRONG>checked</STRONG></B>.</li>
   <LI>For Netscape, choose &quot;Edit <IMG BORDER="0"
    SRC="../../Images/rarrow.png" WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="9"> Preferences&quot;.
    Under the Category &quot;Advanced <IMG BORDER="0"
    SRC="../../Images/rarrow.png" WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="9">
    Proxies&quot;, click the "Manual proxy configuration" button, and
    ensure that the "No Proxy for" box contains "localhost".</LI>
  </UL>
 </LI>
</UL>

<H2><A name="addon"></A>Add-on Process Sets</H2>
<P>The Process Dashboard was written to allow various processes to be 
followed, not just the PSP processes.  As such, we can offer add-on process 
sets that can be installed into the dashboard.  Check the downloads section 
of our website at <U>http://processdash.sourceforge.net</u> for the latest 
add-on process sets.</p>

<P>To install an add-on process set:</P>
<UL>
 <LI>Locate the file "<I>pspdash.jar</I>" on your system. (If you are on a 
   Windows system, this file is most likely located in the directory "<I>C:\Program Files\Process Dashboard</I>".) 
 <LI>Download the add-on process set from our website. When your browser asks 
   you whether you want to save the file or open it; choose 
   <B><I>Save</I></B>.&nbsp; Save the file into the directory you found in 
   the previous step. (In other words, the <I>pspdash.jar</I> file and the 
   add-on process file should be side-by-side in the same directory.  
   <STRONG><I>Do not</I></STRONG> overwrite the <I>pspdash.jar</I> file, just 
   save the process file into the same directory.)</li>
 <LI>If the dashboard is running, you will need to restart it for the new 
   processes to be found. </LI>
</UL>

<HR>

<H2><A name="upgrade"></A>Upgrade to New Version</H2>
<OL>
 <LI>If the dashboard is currently running, stop it first.</li>
 <LI>Locate the file "<EM>pspdash.jar</EM>" on your system. (If you are on a 
   Windows system, this file is most likely located in the directory "<EM>C:\Program Files\Process Dashboard</EM>".)</li>
 <LI>Download the new version of the dashboard from 
   <u>http://processdash.sourceforge.net/upgrade.html</u> and following the 
   directions. When your browser asks you whether you want to save the file 
   or open it; choose <STRONG>Save</STRONG>. Save the file to the location 
   you found in step 2, <STRONG>overwriting the existing</STRONG> 
  "<EM>pspdash.jar</EM>" <STRONG>file</STRONG>.</li>
 <LI>You can then run the dashboard as you normally would.</li>
 <LI>Please take a moment to read over the release notes for the new 
   version.  Please consider subscribing to our announcements mailing list.  
   We will send email to this mailing list when new versions of the tool 
   are available.  You can subscribe to the list at

<H2><A name="customwindowsinstallation"></A>Custom Windows Installation </H2>

<P>Even if your system default browser is not listed above, you can still
use the dashboard.  Choose a browser from the list of supported browsers
above, and install it on your system. Then follow the instructions below:</P>

<OL>
 <LI>Download and run the Process Dashboard Installer from 
   <font size=-1><u>http://processdash.sourceforge.net/custom_windows_installation.html</u></font> 
   and following the directions. The installation wizard will prompt you 
   first for the <STRONG>Destination Location </STRONG>(the directory where 
   the dashboard program will be installed), then it will prompt you for the 
   <STRONG>Data Folder</STRONG> (which defaults to C:\pspdata).</li>
 <LI>After installation is complete, create a file in the <STRONG>Data 
   Folder</STRONG> called pspdash.ini, and add one of the following lines to 
   that file:

  <TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 width="75%" align=center border=0>
   <TR>
    <TD>browser.command=<EM>C:/Program Files/Internet Explorer/IExplore.exe</EM></TD>
   </TR>
  </TABLE>

  if you want the dashboard to display scripts and forms in Internet Explorer,
  or
  <TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 width="75%" align=center border=0>
   <TR>
    <TD>browser.command=<EM>C:/Program Files/Netscape/Communicator/Program/Netscape.exe</EM></TD>
   </TR>
  </TABLE> 

   to use Netscape. NOTE: make certain to edit the browser path (the part in 
   italics above) so it correctly points to the executable for the browser 
   you wish to use. To separate directory names, use either a forward slash
  ("/") or a double backslash ("\\").
 <LI>You can then run the dashboard by clicking on the "Process Dashboard" 
   desktop icon.</li>

<P>To install the process dashboard on a unix system, follow these steps: </P>
<OL>
 <LI>Make certain you have successfully downloaded and installed a Java 
   Runtime Environment. Your runtime environment needs to conform to the Java 
   Standard Edition 1.3 or higher, and needs support for "Swing"

   dashboard with Internet Explorer on unix systems, but we haven't ever done 
   it before...) <STRONG>Make certain that 'netscape' is in your 
   path</STRONG>.</LI>
 <LI>Download the file pspdash.jar from 
   <u>http://processdash.sourceforge.net/unix_installation.html</u>

   The script should look something like this:<br>
<font size="-2"><tt><br>
#!/bin/sh<br>
cd ~/path/to/your/personal/data/directory<br>
