Corrupt_Statefile_Title=Cannot read hierarchy file
Corrupt_Statefile_Warning_FMT=\
    The dashboard was unable to open and read the file that\n\
    contains your hierarchy.  This problem could be caused by\n\
    insufficient file permissions, or by corrupt data in the\n\
    file itself.  This is a very serious problem; the dashboard\n\
    will not continue until the problem is corrected.  Please\n\
    examine the file:\n        \
        {1}\n\
    and correct the following error{2,choice,0#|1# on line {2}}:\n        \
        {0}\n\
    If you cannot correct this error, the only other course of\n\
    action is to rename or delete the file.  This effectively\n\
    will cause all your data to be lost.

JRE_Requirement_Title=JRE 1.3 Required
JRE_Requirement_Message_FMT=\
    You need to upgrade your Java Runtime Environment!  This\n\
    version of the Process Dashboard requires version 1.3 or\n\
    higher of the Java Runtime Environment.  You are currently\n\
    running Java Runtime Environment version {0}.\n\
\       To download an updated version of the Java Runtime\n\
    Environment, visit   {1}.

Broken_Data_Title=Missing Data Files
Broken_Data_Header=\
	Missing files are preventing the dashboard from opening the\n\
	data for the following projects/tasks\:
Broken_Data_Footer=\
	The most likely cause of this problem is that you created\n\
	the above projects/tasks based on an add-on process set,\n\
	then deleted the file containing that add-on process set.\n\
	If you use add-on process sets located in a network directory,\n\
	this problem could also occur when the network is unavailable.\n\
	The recommended course of action is to shut down the\n\
	dashboard, reinstall the add-on process set, then restart the\n\
	dashboard.  Until you do this, the data for these\n\
	projects/tasks will be inaccessible and/or incomplete.
