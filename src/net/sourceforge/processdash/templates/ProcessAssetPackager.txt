Creates a Process Dashboard add-on containing organizational process assets.

Usage: java -jar pkgAssets.jar <dest> <pkgId> <pkgVers> <pkgName> [assets...]

Where:
    <dest>     the name of the ZIP or JAR file to write
    <pkgId>    an alphanumeric identifier for this collection of assets
    <pkgVers>  the version number for this build of this asset collection.
               Version numbers must be a series of numbers, separated by
               the period character (for example, "1.2.3.4567"). If
               you supply a version number ending with "...", a build
               timestamp will be appended as the last element of the
               version number.
    <pkgName>  the name to display to the user to describe this collection
               of assets. (This value will appear in the "Help > About >
               Configuration" page of the Process Dashboard.) If the name
               includes spaces, make certain to enclose the name in quotes,
               as appropriate for the command-shell you are using.
