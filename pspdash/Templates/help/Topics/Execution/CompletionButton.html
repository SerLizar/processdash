<H1>Using the completion button</H1>

<P>As you complete the activities for a given process phase, you should mark
that phase as completed via the completion button.</P>

<p><img src="../../Images/PointToCompletionButton.png"></p>

<P>When you mark a phase as completed, the data associated with that phase 
will show up in the various Project Summary forms in the "To Date" entries, 
the data analysis reports, and the PROBE tool.</p>

<P>When the completion button is pressed the dashboard moves the current 
phase to the next phase prescribed by the running process template.  If the 
timer is currently running, it will automatically stop recording time for the 
given phase and start the timing of the next phase.  For more information on 
using the timer, see the <a href="PlayPause.html">Using the Play/Pause 
button</A> help topic.</P>

<P>Phases marked as complete will show a little checkmark in the completion 
button.</P>

<P>This example shows the Design phase of a PSP0 project marked as 
complete.</P>

<P>If you need to go back to a previous phases in a given process, you can 
still do so even if the completion button has been pressed.  The dashboard 
will still accumulate time in whatever phase you make current.</P>

<a name="freeze"></a><h2>"Freezing" data</h2>

<P>By default, the dashboard will "freeze" appropriate pieces of data when 
the corresponding project phase is marked as completed.  The two points where 
this happens are at the end of the Planning phase and at the end of the 
project.</p>

<P>In PSP process levels 0.1 and above, when you are planning your project 
the dashboard will use your historical data to help you create an estimate of 
how your total time will be distributed across the process phases.  Once you 
click the completion button to complete the planning phase, your time 
estimate and those computed data elements will be frozen so that your planned 
data will always stay constant (if you really want to know more about why 
this is necessary, read the <a href="#gory">gory details</a> section).</p>

<P>When you click the completion button on the postmortem phase of the 
project, the project itself gets marked as completed.  At this point the To 
Date numbers will be brought up to date and frozen.  This will enable you to 
view this report again in the future without having the To Date numbers 
changing in the report.</p>

<P>One side effect of the freezing of data is that if you want to change your 
time estimate, you will have to navigate back to the Planning phase and mark 
it as incomplete by clicking the completion button again.  Once it has been 
marked as incomplete the dashboard will allow you to enter a different 
estimate.</p>

<p>The same is true of the To Date items on the report.  If you navigate back 
to an old project and start logging time to it, the "Actual" columns will 
update as required, but the To Date columns will not.  You will need to mark 
the postmortem phase as incomplete so that the To Date items will thaw out 
and recalculate.</p>

<a name="gory"></a><h3>The gory details</h3>

<P>The "To Date" elements on the forms are set up to always recalculate 
themselves based on all the completed data in the dashboard's database.  This 
is fine for most circumstances.  However, if you ever want to go back and 
look at a Project Plan Summary form (or other report or chart) from an older 
completed project, the dashboard would recalculate those To Date elements all 
over again.  This time the calculation would include data that was not 
available at the time the project was originally finished.  This would 
preclude anyone from being able to reproduce a previous Project Plan Summary 
accurately.</p>

<P>Actually, it gets a bit worse.  Since the estimates of time spent in each 
of the process phases is based on the To Date data, all the estimates would 
be changing on those older forms as well.  In fact, once you had planned your 
estimates for time in the various phases, those planned times would 
immediately change on the Project Plan Summary at the end of the project when 
you completed the current project.  The current project's data would be 
incorporated back into those estimates!</p>

<P>The way we chose to deal with this problem is to introduce the freezing of 
data elements.  Now, once your planning is finished the data will freeze and 
not be "corrupted" by the finishing of the current project.  Also it becomes 
possible to recreate older Project Plan Summary forms since their formulas 
won't be changing anymore.</p>

<P>If you do not desire this kind of behavior (e.g. you <b>always</b> want 
the To Date items to reflect the current situation) you can turn off this 
behavior by setting the <B><i>[what goes here?]</i></B> option in the 
configuration file.  For more information about the configuration file and 
what can be set there, see the <a 
href="../AdvancedTopics/ConfigurationFile.html">configuration file</a> help 
topic.</p>
