<P>By default, the dashboard will "freeze" appropriate pieces of data when
the corresponding project phase is marked as completed.  The two points
where this happens are at the end of the Planning phase and at the end of
the project.</p>

<P>In PSP process levels 0.1 and above, when you are planning your project 
the dashboard will use your historical data to help you create an estimate of 
how your total time will be distributed across the process phases.  Once you 
click the completion checkbox to complete the planning phase, all your 
Planned data will be baselined. The estimates you entered for size and time, 
along with all the calculated computed data elements for estimated data, will 
be frozen so that your planned data will always stay constant (if you really 
want to know more about why this is necessary, read the <a href="#gory">gory 
details</a> section).</p>

<P>Similarly, when you mark the project complete, the To Date numbers will be 
brought up to date and frozen.  This will enable you to view this report 
again in the future without having the To Date numbers changing in the 
report.</p>

<P>One side effect of the freezing of data is that if you want to change
your time or size estimate, you will have to navigate back to the Planning
phase and mark it as incomplete by clicking the completion checkbox again.
Once it has been marked as incomplete the dashboard will allow you to enter
a different estimate.</p>

<p>The same is true of the To Date items on the report.  If you navigate back
to an old project and start logging time to it, the Actual columns will
update as required, but the To Date columns will not.  You will need to mark
the project as incomplete so that the To Date items will thaw out and
recalculate.</p>

<p>The Project Completion checkbox is located on the Project Plan Summary 
form.</p>

<h2 NO_NUMBER><a name="gory"></a>The gory details</h2>

<P>The "To Date" elements on the forms are set up to always recalculate 
themselves based on all the completed data in the dashboard's database.  This 
is fine for most circumstances.  However, if you ever want to go back and 
look at a Project Plan Summary form (or other report or chart) from an older 
completed project, the dashboard would recalculate those To Date elements all 
over again.  This time the calculation would include data that was not 
available at the time the project was originally finished.  This would 
preclude anyone from being able to reproduce a previous Project Plan Summary 
accurately.</p>

<P>Actually, it gets a bit worse.  Since the estimates of time spent in each 
of the process phases is based on the To Date data, all the estimates would 
be changing on those older forms as well.</p>

<p>In fact, even within a project once you had planned your estimates for 
time in the various phases, those planned times would immediately change on 
the Project Plan Summary at the end of the project when you completed it.  
If the Planned data were still live, the current project's data would be 
incorporated back into those estimates!</p>

<P>The way we chose to deal with this problem is to introduce the freezing of 
data elements.  Now, once your planning is finished the data will freeze and 
not be "corrupted" by the finishing of the current project.  Also it becomes 
possible to recreate older Project Plan Summary forms since their formulas 
won't be changing anymore.</p>

<P>If you do not desire this kind of behavior (e.g. you always want the To 
Date items to reflect the current situation) you can turn off this behavior 
by setting the <code>dataFreezing.disabled</code> option in the configuration 
file.  For more information about the configuration file and what can be set 
there, see the <a 
href="../AdvancedTopics/ConfigurationFile.html">configuration file</a> help 
topic.</p>
