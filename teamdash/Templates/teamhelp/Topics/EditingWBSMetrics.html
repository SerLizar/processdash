<h1>Editing Metrics in the Work Breakdown Structure Editor</h1>

<p>In the Work Breakdown Structure Editor, the right-hand side of the
screen contains several tabs. These tabs display various collections
of metrics for the items in your WBS. Select a tab to view or edit
those metrics.</p>

<p>Within these metrics panels, several typesetting conventions are
used to convey information. </p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/wbs-with-time-estimates.png"></p>

<p>For example, gray text is used to indicate read-only data. If text
is not gray, you can edit it directly. For example, in the second line
of the table above, you can see that Component&nbsp;A is estimated to
contain 1,230 lines of code, and take 94.8 hours. You may edit these
numbers directly! (This often takes people by surprise, as many
planning tools do not permit you to edit top-down values.)  This
feature can be very useful and powerful for planning. For example,
historical data rates (inherited from a process/workflow definition)
may have produced the estimate of 94.8 hours for Component A. If your
team feels that Component A is more complex and will require
additional time, simply edit the value 94.8 and replace it with your
team's actual estimate for the component.  The time estimates for all
of the tasks underneath Component A will automatically be scaled
proportionally.  Similarly, you can change a set of initials in the
Assigned To column to reassign an entire branch of the WBS from one
person to another.</p>

<p>Some values may be displayed in a bold red font to indicate a serious
error.  Hover the mouse over the value in question, and a tool tip will
explain the problem.  Less serious problems are highlighted with a bold
blue font.  (For example, the tasks in the picture above have not been
assigned to any team members.)</p>

<p>For keyboard-based navigation of the user interface, you can also
select the active tab by pressing Ctrl-T on Windows/Unix, or Command-T on
Mac OS X. After selecting a tab in this way, press the "Tab" key on your
keyboard to move back to the WBS table.</p>

<p>Support is also provided for copying and pasting metrics data from
one part of the WBS to another, and for copying and pasting data from
other programs such as Excel. If you copy a rectangle of cells in an
Excel spreadsheet, you can paste the data into a similar rectangle of
cells on the right-hand side of the WBS, and vice versa.  To copy,
type Ctrl-C; to paste, type Ctrl-V. These operations are repeated on
the Edit menu as "Copy WBS Data" and "Paste WBS Data".  (Note that the
copy and paste buttons on the toolbar will paste entirely new WBS
items into the hierarchy, rather than pasting data into existing
cells.)</p>

<h2><a name="customColumns"></a>Custom WBS Columns</h2>

<p>As you create your project plan, you may find the need to capture
information that is project, team, or organization-specific.  For example,
you might want to record details like:</p>

<ul>
<li>The project-specific priority for various items</li>
<li>The ticket number from your issue tracking system</li>
<li>The subsystem that a particular change will affect</li>
<li>The customer that requested a particular change</li>
</ul>

<p>Often, this information can simply be entered into the 
<a href="CreateBalancedPlan.html#taskNotes">task note</a>.  But if you
would like to take a more structured approach, you can create custom
columns to hold particular pieces of data.  Just choose "Custom
Columns..."  from the "Tabs" menu.  This approach can provide a number
of benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>It can be easier to ensure that all components are categorized, if that
    is important for a given data element.</li>
<li>You can optionally enter a list of legal values that users can choose
    from for a particular column.</li>
<li>Autocompletion support can be provided to help with data entry.</li>
<li>The values you enter in a custom column can be used to
    <a href="TeamLeader.html#labelFiltering">filter</a> team charts
    and reports.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you create custom columns, they will appear on the "Task Details" tab
by default.  However, it is usually more convenient to create new tabs that
group together the columns you edit most often, as described below.</p>

<h2><a name="customTabs"></a>Custom Tabs</h2>

<p>The WBS Editor provides several default tabs showing preset
collections of data, but you are not limited to those tabs. To support
team-specific planning styles, click the "New Tab" that appears to the
right of the preexisting tabs. You can customize the columns that
appear on your new tab by selecting Tabs&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Change Tab
Columns. Although you can alter the columns that appear on your custom
tabs, the original tabs will always remain the same; this provides
continuity for other coaches or mentors that need to look at your team
plan.</p>
