<h1>Earned Value vs. Cost</h1>

<p>This chart displays planned and actual progress and cost at a glance.</p>

<p>The horizontal axis depicts the passage of time.  The lines on the chart
convey various measures of progress and cost:</p>

<ul>

<li>The red <b>"Plan Value"</b> line shows your planned progress.  This
line corresponds exactly to the Plan line in the
<a href="EV-cumValueChart.html">Cumulative Earned Value</a> chart; the only
difference is that the vertical axis of this chart is labeled in hours
instead of % complete.  Thus, the Plan line will start at zero, and end at
the total number of hours you plan to spend on the tasks in this task
list.</li>

<li>The blue <b>"Actual Value"</b> line shows your actual progress.  Once
again, this line corresponds exactly to the Actual line in the
<a href="EV-cumValueChart.html">Cumulative Earned Value</a> chart.  In PSP,
the value of a task is determined by its planned time; so each time you
mark a task complete, the blue line will rise by the number of hours that
you planned to spend on that task.</li>

<li>The green <b>"Actual Cost"</b> line shows the actual time that has been
spent on tasks that have been marked complete.  In other words, each time
you mark a task complete, the green line will rise by the number of hours
that you actually spent on that task.</li>

</ul>

<h3 NO_NUMBER="t">Interpretation</h3>

<p>Comparing the red and blue lines will tell you whether you are ahead or
behind schedule.  This may seem obvious, because these two lines display
the exact same data as the Plan and Actual lines on the 
<a href="EV-cumValueChart.html">Cumulative Earned Value</a> chart (just
with a different vertical scale).</p>

<p>Comparing the blue and green lines will tell you whether tasks are
taking more or less time than expected.  If the green line is above the
blue line, tasks are taking more time than planned.  If the green line is
below the blue line, tasks are taking less time than planned.</p>

<p>You can compare the red line to the green line to get a <u>rough</u>
idea of whether you are devoting as much time to the project as planned.
However, this comparison will only be an approximation, because the lines
on this chart do not include data from incomplete tasks.  To accurately
compare planned and actual time spent, view the
<a href="EV-cumDirectTimeChart.html">Cumulative Direct Time</a> chart.</p>

<p>This chart may be very familiar to individuals that have experience with
traditional earned value management systems.  The red "Plan Value" line
corresponds to BCWS (Budgeted Cost for Work Scheduled).  The blue "Actual
Value" line corresponds to BCWP (Budgeted Cost for Work Performed).  And
the green "Actual Cost" line corresponds to ACWP (Actual Cost for Work
Performed).</p>
