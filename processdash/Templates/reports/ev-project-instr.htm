<h1>Export to Microsoft Project - Instructions</h1>

<p>This page will assist you in exporting a snapshot of your earned
value plan to Microsoft Project.  Follow the steps below:

<ol>

<li class="padBelow">Earned value data is exported to a Microsoft Project
XML file.  The download of this file may start automatically; if it does
not, <a href="ev.class?msProjXml&amp;showSaveAs">click here</a>. Save this
file onto your computer.</li>

<li class="pad">In Microsoft Project, choose &quot;File <img
src="/help/Images/rarrow.png"> Open&quot; and select the file you
saved in the first step.  You may have to change the &quot;Files of
type&quot; selector in order to see the XML file.  Click the Open
button.</li>

<li class="pad">An Import Wizard will appear; choose to import the file as
a new project, and click Finish.</li>

<li class="pad">You may see a warning that task start dates precede
the start date of the project, or that task end dates fall after the
finish date of the project.  These warnings are harmless and can be
ignored.</li>

<li class="pad">A new project will be created and populated with the
current data from your earned value plan.  If you wish, you can save
this project for future use.  Keep in mind that this is only a
snapshot of your earned value project.  The data in this snapshot will
not be refreshed when you make progress in the future.  Also, changes
made in this Microsoft Project file will not be reflected in the
dashboard.</li>

</ol></p>

<hr>

<p>The XML file format was introduced in Microsoft Project 2003.  If
you are using an earlier version of MS Project, you can use the older
<a href="ev-project-instr-csv.htm">CSV format</a> instead.</p>
