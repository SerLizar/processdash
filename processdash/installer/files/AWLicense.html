<P>This module incorporates templates, scripts, and other materials
from the book by Watts S. Humphrey, A Discipline for Software
Engineering.  Copyright &copy; 1995 by Addison-Wesley.  These materials

<P>Although I understand that I may use the Personal Software
Process<sup>SM</sup> (PSP<sup>SM</sup>) materials provided in this
Dashboard module, I will not copy, modify, or distribute these
materials without first obtaining written permission from
Addison-Wesley.  I understand that I may use the materials in this
module in conjunction with the Process Dashboard tool, but I may not
use them for other purposes without first obtaining written permission
from Addison-Wesley.  Furthermore, I will not represent myself as
using the PSP process unless I have been trained to do so by an
SEI-authorized PSP instructor.</P>

<P>The PSP was developed by Watts S. Humphrey and is described in his
book, <i> A Discipline for Software Engineering</i>. The PSP provides
a powerful way to develop software, but it is effective only if
properly used. While this module aids trained professionals in
applying the PSP methods, it does not provide instruction on how to
use the PSP.</P>

<P>Personal Software Process and PSP are service marks of Carnegie
Mellon University.</P>
