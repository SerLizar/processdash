<H1>PSP<sup>(SM)</sup> Scripts/Forms Not Installed</H1>

<p>PSP process definitions for use with the dashboard <b>are
available</b> at no cost, but regrettably, these process definitions
must be distributed as a separate download from the Process
Dashboard. (This change is effective beginning in version 1.6; for
more information, 
<a href="/help/Topics/Overview/Separation.html">click here</a>.)
During installation, you chose not to install these process
definitions.  As a result, the PSP process scripts and forms are not
available.</p>

<p>If you decide in the future that you would like to use these
process definitions, run the Process Dashboard
<a href="/help/Topics/Overview/HowToInstall.html#installer">installer
program</a> again, and opt to install the PSP package(s).</p>
