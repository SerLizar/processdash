<P>Just as it is necessary to plan a software project, it is also 
advantageous to learn from the experience of a software project as well.  In 
the PSP course, a lot of postmortem time is spent calculating the various 
metrics and recording them.  The Process Dashboard will take away much of the 
tedium associated with a Postmortem analysis.</p>

<P>For the most part, the work involved in a postmortem for a project that 
uses the Process Dashboard is automated.  The dashboard knows how to fill out 
the Project Plan Summary form with all the derived metrics that are a part of 
the PSP, and it also knows how to create many helpful graphs to let you get a 
visual feel for how the data look.</p>

<p>The main thing that isn't done automatically is the final LOC counts.
You can use the built-in <A HREF="LOCCounter.html">LOC counter</A>, or an
external LOC counter of your own choosing, to calculate LOC; then enter 
the final counts on the Project Plan Summary form (for PSP levels 0 and 0.1) 
and on the Size Estimating Template (for PSP levels 1 through 3).</p>
