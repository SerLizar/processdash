<h2>Restore Team Project Data</h2>

<p>When you join a team project, the actual data you collect (e.g. time log
entries, defects, task completion dates) is stored in your personal dashboard
database.  When you perform an "Export My Data Now" operation, that actual
data is published to the Team Dashboard so it can be used for team
reports.</p>

<p>If your personal dashboard database is lost or corrupted (for example, due
to a hard drive crash), the actual data you've collected will be lost.</p>

<ul>

<li>If you have a <b>recent backup</b> of your personal dashboard data, it's a
good idea to restore your personal dashboard from that backup.  Of course,
you'll still be missing any data you collected after that backup was
made.</li>

<li style="margin-top:12px">If you <b>don't have a backup</b> of your personal
dashboard, you'll have to create a new personal dashboard database and rejoin
the project.  Rejoining will create a new <b>plan</b> for you from the tasks
found in the WBS, but it will not restore any of the <b>actual</b> data. The
newly created personal database will not contain any of the time log entries,
defects, etc. that you collected before the crash.</li>

</ul>

<p>In those scenarios, you can use the form below to pull actual data from the
Team Dashboard and restore it to your personal database.  Two options are
possible:</p>


<h3>Option 1: Last Personal Export File</h3>

<p>The dashboard can attempt to pull actual data from the last file you
exported:</p>

<form action="restoreIndivData" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <input type='hidden' name='__POST_TOKEN'
           value='<!--#echo var=[POST_TOKEN//RestoreIndivData] -->'>
    Personal Export Filename:
    <input type="text" name="filename" size="40" value="<!--#echo var=[EXPORT_FILE] -->">
    <input type="submit" name="filenameOK" value="OK">
</form>

<p>This can be effective if you rejoined the project but have <b>not yet
performed</b> an "Export My Data Now" operation; in that case the export file
will still contain data exported from your old personal dashboard database.
(If you've already done a "sync" or "export" after rejoining, this empty
dashboard will have already overwritten the export file from the original
dashboard, so this techique won't find any data to import.)</p>


<h3>Option 2: Team Dashboard Backup File</h3>

<p>The dashboard can attempt to extract data from a Team Dashboard backup:</p>

<form action="restoreIndivData" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <input type='hidden' name='__POST_TOKEN'
           value='<!--#echo var=[POST_TOKEN//RestoreIndivData] -->'>
    Team Dashboard Backup File:
    <input type="file" name="file">
    <input type="submit" name="uploadOK" value="OK">
</form>

<p>The "File" menu in the Team Dashboard includes a "Save Data Backup" option.
If someone on your team used that option in the past, and saved a team backup
<b>before you rejoined the project</b>, that backup will contain the actual
data you exported before the team backup was made.  Upload a Team Dashboard
backup via the form above, and the dashboard will look inside to see if it
contains any of your actual data.</p>
