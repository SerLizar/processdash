<H1>Team Use - PSP Data and Earned Value</H1>

This approach can take your team a <u>long</u> way toward using
high-maturity techniques to track project progress.  However,
graphical user interfaces are not currently provided to accomplish all
of the steps below, so some manual configuration will be required.

<p>To correctly perform this manual configuration, it is helpful to
understand the rollup process used by this approach.  In this
approach, each team member will run their own personal instance of the
dashboard, which they use to capture and track their own personal
metrics.  In addition, a team instance of the dashboard is run.  This
team instance aggregates team data, calculates rolled-up metrics, and
displays charts and reports of team project data.</p>


<p><center><img src="../../Images/TeamRollupDataFlow.png"></center></p>

<p>To simplify ongoing communication, this approach uses a shared
network directory (labeled "Team Data Directory" in the diagram
above).  Individuals configure their personal dashboard instances to
periodically export metrics data.  Each individual's data is saved
into a different file in this network folder.  Meanwhile, the team
dashboard instance is configured to import data from this same
directory.  The resulting imported data is then rolled up using
existing mechanisms already present in the Process Dashboard.</p>

<p>To use this approach, follow the steps below.</p>

<H2 NO_NUMBER>Create Team Data Directory</H2>

Most teams have a folder on a shared network drive where project
documents are stored.  Create a subdirectory specifically for
dashboard metrics data.  The main requirement is that all team members
should have the ability to save files to this directory.  In a Windows
environment, each team member will most likely want to map the network
drive so the folder is accessible via a simple filename.

<p>Depending on your organizational culture, you may also wish to
tighten permissions to prevent non-team members from viewing the
data.</p>

<H2 NO_NUMBER>Create Team Dashboard Instance</H2>

The word "instance" may be confusing to some.  By "instance," we mean
a running dashboard program window, with its own data storage area
that differs from other "instances."

<p>You can run the Team Dashboard instance just about anywhere.
Practically speaking, it is probably easiest to run it on the project
manager's computer or team leader's computer. If you have access to a
shared network computer, you might decide to run it there instead;
however, you may occasionally need to interact with the graphical user
interface for the team dashboard instance, so I would not recommend
running it on an inaccessible computer locked in a server room.</p>

<p>Creating a team dashboard instance is fairly simple:</p>

<ol>

<li>Install the Process Dashboard on the computer in question if it is
    not there already.</li>

<li>If you are running the team dashboard on the project manager's
    computer or the team leader's computer, then it will be common for
    them to have a personal dashboard instance as well.  This isn't a
    problem.  To create a second instance:

    <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">

    <li>Make a copy of the shortcut you use to run the dashboard.
        Rename the shortcut with a name like "Team Dashboard."</li>

    <li>Right click on your new shortcut and choose "Properties."</li>

    <li>In the window that appears, change the "Start in:" field to
        name a different directory.  (By default, it will typically
        read "<tt>C:\pspdata</tt>".)  Create a new directory on your
        hard drive (for example "<tt>C:\teamdata</tt>" - but anything
        is fine) and enter its name in the "Start in" field.
        <B>Remember this directory - you'll use it in step 3
        below.</b></li>

    <li>Put your cursor at the end of the "Target" field, and append a
        space, followed by the double quote character (&quot;),
        followed by the words Team Dashboard, followed by another
        double quote character.  This will cause the words 
	"Team Dashboard" to be displayed in the title bar of the Team
        Dashboard instance.</li>

    <li>Click OK</li>

    <li>Try launching the dashboard using your new shortcut.  The new
        shortcut should launch a dashboard instance that is completely
        independent from your original dashboard instance, and which
        displays "Team Dashboard" in its title bar.  Once you have
        successfully verified that the new shortcut works as expected,
        shut down the new dashboard instance.</li>

    </ol></li>

<li>Next, we'll configure the new dashboard instance.  Navigate to the
    directory you created in step 2c above and find the file
    "<tt>pspdash.ini</tt>".  (If the file does not exist, then you're
    either looking in the wrong place, or you didn't perform all the
    steps above as instructed!) Make certain the team dashboard is NOT
    running. Then double-click the "<tt>pspdash.ini</tt>" file to open
    it.  Add the following lines to the bottom of the file:

<pre>http.port=3000
http.allowRemote=true
ev.enableRollup=true
import.directories=Imported=&gt;<span class="td">T:/teamdir/pspdata</span></pre>

    Now, edit the last line: replace the characters shown in blue type
    with the real path to your "Team Data Directory".  Even though
    Windows would normally use backslash characters to separate
    directory names, you should use forward slash characters instead,
    as shown above.  This last line configures your team instance to
    automatically import data from the named directory.  It will scan
    the contents of that directory every 10 minutes or so to see if
    the timestamps on any files have changed, and automatically import
    any new data it finds.</li>

</ol>

<p>Your team dashboard instance is now created and configured.</p>

<H2 NO_NUMBER>Configure Individual Dashboard Instances</H2>

Next, you should set up the Dashboard instances for each team member.
Have each team member follow these steps:

<ol>

<li>Run the dashboard, and open the Hierarchy Editor.  Somewhere in
    your dashboard hierarchy, create a "Node" (using the &quot;Edit
    <img src="../../Images/rarrow.png"> Add&nbsp;Node&quot; menu) to
    represent the work you will perform for this project.  In the text
    below, we'll pretend that the node created is &quot;<span
    class="tp">/Project/Team&nbsp;Project</span>&quot;, but you should
    give your node a meaningful name, that represents the project at
    hand.  Save the changes by selecting &quot;File <img
    src="../../Images/rarrow.png"> Save&quot; from the Hierarchy
    Editor window.  Close the Hierarchy Editor.<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Later, when you
    begin planning your personal work for this project, you should
    create nodes and PSP templates representing project tasks.  These
    should be placed hierarchically underneath this project node to
    ensure that their metrics are included in the team rollup.)</li>

<li>From the C menu on the main dashboard window, choose Task and
    Schedule.  Create a new schedule to represent your project.  In
    the task list for this new schedule, <u>add the node</u> you
    created in step 1 above.  Save the schedule.  Close the Task &amp;
    Schedule window.</li>

<li><b>Shut down the dashboard.</b>  (Don't skip this step!)</li>

<li>Open the directory containing your personal data - on Windows
    systems, this defaults to "<tt>C:\pspdata</tt>" unless you changed
    it when installing the dashboard.  Find the file called
    "<tt>global.dat</tt>" and open it in an editor like Notepad.  Add
    a line to the end of the file with the form:

    <pre><i class="tp">&lt;projectPath&gt;</i>/EXPORT_FILE=&quot;<i class="td">&lt;teamDirectory&gt;</i>/<i class="in">&lt;yourName&gt;</i>.txt</pre>

    For example:

    <pre><b class="tp">Project/Team Project</b>/EXPORT_FILE=&quot;<b class="td">T:/teamdir/pspdata</b>/<b class="in">Bob</b>.txt</pre>

    Carefully make the following edits:<ul>

    <li>Where the orange text appears in the line above, you should
        enter the full name of the team project node you created in
        step 1, minus the initial slash character.</li>

    <li>Where the blue text appears, you should enter the complete
        path to the team data directory, using forward slashes
        (<tt>/</tt>) instead of backslashes (<tt>\</tt>).</li>

    <li>Where the green text appears, you should enter your name or
        initials (just make certain you choose a filename that is
        different from any of your team members).</li>

    <li>Black text in the line should be copied exactly.</li>

    </ul>Do not include any additional whitespace characters (not at
    the beginning of the line, nor the end, nor between any of the
    components above).</p>

<li>Restart the dashboard, then shut it down again.  As it shuts down,
    you may briefly see a small window with a progress bar that
    displays the text "Auto Exporting."  Check the team data
    directory.  It should contain a file with the name you specified
    in step 4 above.  If it no such file exists, then you most likely
    made an error in step 4 above; repeat steps 3 and 4 again.</li>

</ol>


<H2 NO_NUMBER>Create Team Rollups</H2>

Once all team members have configured their dashboards as described
above, data should be available to the team dashboard.  You'll want to
create two different types of team rollup: a rolled up earned value
schedule, and rolled up project metrics.

<H3 NO_NUMBER>Creating the Rolled-up Earned Value Schedule</H3>

<ol>

<li>Open the Team Dashboard instance and select "Task &amp; Schedule"
    from its C menu.  If it displays a window giving you an option to
    open an existing schedule, click "New."</li>

<li>When you see a dialog entitled "Create New Schedule", enter a name
    for your team project schedule and select "Create EV Roll-up" from
    the drop-down list.  (If you don't see a drop-down list, then you
    didn't correctly configure the team dashboard - see step 3 in the
    "Create Team Dashboard Instance" section above.)  Click OK to
    create the new rollup schedule.</li>

<li>The window that appears should give you an opportunity to add
    schedules to the rollup; add each individual's schedule in turn.
    (If some individual's schedule does not appear in the list, then
    they have not correctly configured their personal dashboard as
    described above.)  Save the team rollup schedule.</li>

<li>You can view an HTML report of the team rollup schedule by
    clicking the "Report" button.  If the team dashboard instance is
    running, you can access this same report from other computers by
    typing an appropriate URL in a web browser; just copy and paste
    the URL for the report, and replace the word "localhost" with the
    name of the computer where the team dashboard instance is
    running.</li>

</ol>


<H3 NO_NUMBER>Creating Rolled-up PSP Metrics</H3>

<ol>

<li>Open the Team Dashboard instance and select "Hierarchy Editor"
    from its C menu.</li>

<li>Highlight a node in the hierarchy editor like "Project" and select
    the &quot;Edit <img src="../../Images/rarrow.png"> Add Template
    <img src="../../Images/rarrow.png"> Rollup PSP Data&quot; menu
    option.  A new node will be created; give it a name appropriate
    for your project.  Save and close the Hierarchy Editor.</li>

<li>Use the Hierarchy Menus to navigate to the node you just created.
    Click the drop-down arrow to the right of the Script Button.
    Choose the "Analyze Rollup Data" option.  An analysis web page for
    the project will be displayed.  This website rolls up data from
    PSP tasks in the project. (If people use a non-PSP process to
    perform their work, that data will not be rolled up into this
    analysis.)</li>

<li>By default, the analysis web page will include data from all
    completed PSP tasks in the team project.  You can change the
    criteria by selecting the "Edit Data Rollup Filter" option on the
    Script Button's drop-down menu. By editing the values on the
    rollup filter form, you can instruct the rollup to include<ul>

      <li>Data from all PSP tasks, whether they are complete or not</li>
      <li>Data for all tasks with certain keywords (this can be a useful
          way to view a subset of the data in your project)</li></ul>

    If you find yourself editing the filter frequently to see
    different data views, you can instead repeat step 2 above to
    create any number of distinct rollups.  Then provide different
    filter criteria for each rollup.  5. If the team dashboard
    instance is running, you can access these same analyses from other
    computers by typing an appropriate URL in a web browser; just copy
    and paste the URL for the analysis web page, and replace the word
    "localhost" with the name of the computer where the team dashboard
    instance is running.

</ol>
