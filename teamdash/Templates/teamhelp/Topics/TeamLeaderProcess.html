<h1>Analyzing Process Metrics</h1>

<p>To analyze data from the various workflows in your project, select the
"Workflow Process Analysis" item from the list on the right side of the Team
Dashboard window.  When the list of project workflows is displayed in your web
browser, click the name of a particular workflow to see aggregate metrics.</p>

<p>The report will roll up data from all the WBS components that used this
workflow and that are 100% complete.  By default it will roll up all component
data from all of the projects in the Team Dashboard, but you can click the
Filter link at the top to customize this behavior.</p>

<p>The resulting report displays a number of charts and metrics, such as:</p>

<ul>

<li>End-to-end team productivity, which you can use to update the "Rate" you
use in the Common Team Workflows window.</li>

<li>The average percentage of time spent in each workflow step, which you can
use to update the "%" column in the Common Team Workflows window.</li>

<li>Information on the number of defects that were added and removed in
various workflow steps.</li>

<li>Information on the average estimating error, which your team can use to
make better estimates in the future.</li>

<li>Information on cost of quality, which you can use to improve the
process.</li>

</ul>

<p>These metrics are extremely useful for ongoing quality monitoring, and for
end-of-cycle postmortem analysis.</p>


<h2><a name="workflowMapping"></a>Configuring Workflow Mappings</h2>

<p>Historical data is extremely valuable for planning, tracking, and analysis.
So when you view the Workflow Process Analysis report for a given project, the
dashboard will pull in data from other projects if they include a workflow
with the same name and steps.  For example, if several of your project cycles
all have a workflow named "SW Development," and those workflows contain steps
with the same names as the current workflow, then data from all of these
matching steps will be included in the calculations for the Workflow Process
Analysis report.</p>

<p>But at times, this simple name-based matching is insufficient.  For
example, if your team changes the name of a workflow or alters the steps
inside, the names will no longer match, and the historical data will not map
forward anymore.  Fortunately, you can resolve these issues by telling the
dashboard how workflows map to each other.</p>

<p>To view or edit workflow mappings, open the Workflow Process Analysis
report for the workflow you are interested in, then click the
"Configuration..." link at the top of the page.  On the configuration page,
click the link to configure workflow mappings.  This will open a page that
shows mappings for the workflow in question.</p>

<p>The workflow of interest is shown at the top of the page.  The brown boxes
on the left below show other other workflows whose data is currently being
included in the analysis.  For symmetry, the blue boxes on the right show
other workflows that include data from the current workflow.  Click on any of
these boxes, and you will see how the steps map from one workflow to another.
To change these, click the "Edit Mappings" button at the bottom.  If you wish
to map data in the opposite direction as well, click the "Reverse Mappings"
button and make changes as needed.</p>

<p>Workflow mappings are transitive: so if Workflow A maps to Workflow B, and
Workflow B maps to Workflow C, then Worklow A data will automatically be
included in analyses for Workflow C.  When you add a new mapping between two
previously unrelated workflows, the top-level mapping graph will automatically
display any new transitive relationships.</p>

<p>After you have manually added or edited mappings, the workflow
relationships shown on the top-level mapping graph will fall into two broad
categories:<ul>

<li><b>Explicit</b> mappings are ones that you have manually created or
edited.  These will remain fixed until you edit them again in the future.</li>

<li><b>Implicit</b> mappings are those created by the name-based matching
logic, and those created by following transitive relationships between
workflows.  These may be updated dynamically in the future when phases are
added or renamed, and when transitive relationships are created or
deleted.</li>

</ul></p>

<p>Since these relationships behave differently, it is important to be aware
of the distinction.  Accordingly, the top-level mapping graph will use thicker
lines to indicate explicit mappings.  If you edit a mapping between two
workflows and need to change it later, take note of the thicker lines so you
can make your follow-on edits to the same workflow pair you edited
originally.</p>

<p>Here are some practical examples of how your team might use workflow
mappings:</p>

<p><b>Process Evolution:</b><ul>

    <li>If a team starts a new project cycle and changes the name of a
    workflow, they can map data forward and backward to indicate that these
    two workflows represent the same process, even though the name has
    changed.</li>

    <li>If the team starts a new project cycle and changes the name of a
    workflow step, they can map the data forward and backward to let the
    dashboard know that the step plays the same underlying role in the
    process.</li>

    <li>If a team starts a new project cycle and combines two workflow steps
    into one (because the old steps were too granular), they can declare those
    mappings and still use their historical data for planning in the new
    workflow.</li>

    <li>If a team starts a new project cycle and breaks a workflow step into
    more granular parts, they can state that the new steps all map back to the
    same step in the old workflow; and they can choose the primary step in the
    new workflow that historical data should map into.</li>

    </ul></p>

<p><b>Similar Workflows:</b><ul>

    <li>Often, a team will have several workflows that are tailored versions
    of a common process.  One example might be a comprehensive workflow for
    use on large/complex deliverables, along with a simplified version of the
    same workflow for use on smaller items.  The team can declare
    equivalencies between these two workflows, allowing them to see a report
    that rolls up data from the various tailorings of the process.</li>

    </ul></p>

<p><b>Cross-cutting Analysis:</b><ul>

    <li>For process improvement, analysis, or reporting purposes, you may wish
    to see a report that groups various types of work into large categories.
    For example, your organization might be interested in measuring the
    percentage of time spent on construction versus rework.  Or your team may
    develop different kinds of products, but still be interested in
    understanding how much overall time is spent in analysis, construction,
    and testing.  You can produce these reports by creating a workflow that
    lists the category names, then mapping your other workflows to those
    categories.</li>

    </ul></p>
