<h1>Troubleshooting Network Connectivity</h1>

<p>An individual must "join" a team project to create a link from their
personal dashboard to the relevant team project.  During this process, small
messages are passed between the shared Team Dashboard and the personal Process
Dashboard.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, firewalls or other network configuration problems can
sometimes prevent these messages from being transmitted successfully.  This
problem typically manifests itself via a "Server not found" or "This page
cannot be displayed" error message when an individual attempts to join the
team project.  If this happens in your organization, follow the steps below to
resolve the problem.</p>

<ol>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>First, double-check that the Team Dashboard is
still running.  If you closed the team dashboard, restart it.  Then visit the
Team Project Tools page and resend the "joining hyperlink" to the team members
who need it.</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>If the Team Dashboard is running, but
individuals are still seeing the error message, go to the Team Dashboard
window and choose "Tools&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Preferences."
On the "Miscellaneous" preferences page, check the box to "Use numeric IP when
constructing sharable URLs."  Click OK to apply this change, then visit the
Team Project Tools page again.  The "joining hyperlink" will have changed as a
result of checking the box above. Send the new URL to the team members who
need it, and ask them to try joining again.</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>If these steps still do not work, your team will
need to follow a two-step joining process instead.  On the Team Dashboard
toolbar, choose "Help&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;About Process Dashboard".  When the
About window appears, select the Configuration tab.  This tab will state the
directory where <a href="TeamConfigDir.html">team configuration data</a> is
located; communicate this path to each of the team members.  Then, ask each
team member to take the following steps:

  <ul>

  <li style='margin-top:12.0pt'><a name="indivSteps"></a>Open your team
      member Personal Dashboard, and choose
      "C&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Tools&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Open&nbsp;Dataset".  When
      the Open Dataset window appears, browse to the Team Configuration
      Directory that your team leader told you about, and double-click on the
      <tt>state</tt> file that appears in that directory.</li>

  <li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>The Team Dashboard will open locally on your
      computer.  It may display a message telling you that you have to open in
      read-only mode; if so, click Yes to continue.  When the Team Dashboard
      window opens, make certain the correct project is selected in the tree
      on the left; then choose Team Project Tools from the list on the
      right.</li>

  <li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>Scroll to the bottom of the Team Project Tools
      page, and find the link that reads, "Team members can join this project
      by pointing their web browser to..."  Click that link.</li>

  <li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>You should see the first page of the Team
      Project Setup Wizard.  Follow the steps in that wizard to join the team
      project.</li>

  <li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>When you have finished joining the project,
      you can shut down the Team Dashboard.</li>

  </ul></li>

</ol>
