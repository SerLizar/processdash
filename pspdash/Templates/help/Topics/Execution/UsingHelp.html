<H1>Using help</H1>

<P>This help system is a standard JavaHelp implementation.  Starting the help 
system is as easy as clicking "help" on the "C" (configure) menu.</p> 

<P>Currently the help system provides three ways of accessing help topics:</P>
<UL>
 <LI>A table of contents view</LI>
 <LI>An index view</LI>
 <LI>A search engine view</LI>
</UL>

<P>These three views are access via the three tabs at the top of the left 
screen pane.</P>

<h2>The Table of Contents view</h2>
<P>The table of contents provides a hierarchical organization of the help 
topics.  Items that are shown as folders represent logical groupings of help 
topics and can be clicked to reveal more detailed help.</P>

<h2>The Index view</h2>
<P>The index view provides an alphabetical listing of various keywords on which to find help.</P>

<h2>The Search Engine view</h2>
<P>The search engine view provides a small entry blank where you can enter 
words you would like the help system to search for within the help topics.  
After entering search criteria you will be presented with a list of help 
topics that contained the word or words entered.  To the left of each item 
will be a number indicating how many times the word(s) entered were found in 
that particular help topic.</P>

<h2>The navigation buttons</h2>
<P>The help viewer also provides two navigation buttons at the top left.  
They allow for the familiar "back" and "forward" functionalities that are so 
common in modern web browsers.</P>
