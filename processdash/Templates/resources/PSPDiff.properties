	<FONT SIZE='-1' FACE='Times New Roman'><I>Note: LOC Counts\n\
	generated by this program are straight physical LOC changes,\n\
	excluding comments and blank lines.  Changes in <U>whitespace\n\
	only</U> also are not considered significant. Since your LOC\n\
	counting standard may vary, <b>always doublecheck</B> the computed\n\
	LOC counts by examining the changes below.\n\n\
	<P>Also, realize that the LOC counts generated by this program\n\
	<b>do not</b> account for the following:\n\
	<UL>\n\
	<LI>reused lines of code, which may appear as &quot;Added LOC&quot;.\n\
	<LI>automatically generated code\n\
	<LI>blocks of code that have been moved from one part of the file\n\
	to another, or from one file to another.  These moved blocks will\n\
	show up as both &quot;Added LOC&quot; and &quot;Deleted LOC&quot;.\n\
	<LI>Comment indicators embedded within string literals.\n\
	</UL>\n\
	If any of these situations apply to the code you are comparing,\n\
	then the computed LOC counts below will be incorrect.  You will\n\
	need to determine the correct LOC counts by hand.\n\n\
	<P>It is rather tricky to programmatically determine modified\n\
	LOC, so this program uses the following approach: if a line of\n\
	code has been deleted, and another line appears in its place, the\n\
	deleted/added pair counts instead as a single modified line of\n\
	code.  If you are using any of the standard PROBE methods (A, B,\n\
	C, or D), this approximation will not affect your linear\n\
	regressions in any way.  If, however, you are using multiple\n\
	linear regression techniques that separate &quot;Added LOC&quot;\n\
	and &quot;Modified LOC&quot; into multiple independent variables,\n\
	you will need to examine the changes below to precisely measure\n\
	Added and Modified LOC.<P></FONT>
