<H1>Quick Overview</H1>
<P>We feel that the PSP and the TSP are remarkable technologies that can 
change the face of the software industry, and we share the SEI's zeal to 
promote their widespread use. We feel that a freely available, powerful 
support tool could help to remove one of the most significant barriers to PSP 
/ TSP adoption. We therefore aim to develop a world-class tool under the 
open-source model, and distribute it freely to anyone using the PSP and/or 
TSP.  We feel that this is the least we can do to thank the SEI for 
developing and distributing these remarkable processes. </P>

<h2>A quick look at the tool</h2>

<p><img src="../../Images/DashboardOverview.jpg"></p>

<P>The Process Dashboard attempts to keep itself as small as possible to save 
valuable screen real estate for the actual work of software development.  In 
a very small space the dashboard gives access to a stopwatch-like timer for 
timing activities, a defect entry dialog for capturing defect information, 
all the PSP scripts and forms necessary for doing PSP work, a handy 
"completion button" that allows a quick and easy way to tell the tool that a 
phase of development is complete, menus that llow navigation through the 
project work breakdown structure hierarchy, and a configuration menu to allow 
access to other features of the tool.</P>

<h2>The dashboard and the web browser</h2>

<P>The Process Dashboard uses a web browser for the bulk of its data entry 
and reporting.  See the <a href="HowToInstall.html">Installation</A> help 
topic for more info about which web browsers are supported and how to install 
them if necessary.</P>

<P>The connection between the dashboard and the browser is facilitated by a 
very small web server that is running within the dashboard.  It is this web 
server, combined with some Java scripting, that provides all the live data 
communication between the dashboard and the browser.  One consequence of this 
is that the various reports and charts that are displayed within the browser 
will not be available unless the dashboard is running.</P>

href="ProcessScripts.html">process scripts</a> help topic.</p>
