<H1>Quick Overview</H1>

<P>We feel that the PSP<sup>(SM)</sup> and the 
TSP<sup>(SM)</sup> are remarkable technologies that can
change the face of the software industry, and we share the SEI's zeal to 
promote their widespread use. We feel that a freely available, powerful 
support tool could help to remove one of the most significant barriers to PSP 
/ TSP adoption. We therefore aim to develop a world-class tool under the 
open-source model, and distribute it freely to anyone using the PSP and/or 
TSP.  We feel that this is the least we can do to thank the SEI for 
developing and distributing these remarkable processes.</P>

<p class="ifpsp">You have installed an add-on module which
incorporates templates, scripts, and other materials from the book by
Watts S. Humphrey, <i>A&nbsp;Discipline for Software Engineering</i>.
Copyright &copy;&nbsp;1995 by Addison-Wesley.  These materials are
reproduced with the <a href="Separation.html">permission of the
publisher</a>.</p>

<p class="unlesspsp">PSP process definitions for use with the
dashboard <b>are available</b>, but regrettably, these process
definitions must be distributed as a separate download from the
Process Dashboard. (This change is effective beginning in version 1.6;
for more information, <a href="Separation.html">click here</a>.)  If
you decide in the future that you would like to use these process
definitions, run the Process Dashboard
<a href="HowToInstall.html">installer program</a> again, and opt to
install the PSP package(s).</p>

<p>Personal Software Process<sup>(SM)</sup>, PSP<sup>(SM)</sup>, Team
Software Process<sup>(SM)</sup>, and TSP<sup>(SM)</sup> are service
marks of Carnegie Mellon University.  The open source team that writes
the Process Dashboard is not affiliated with Carnegie Mellon
University.</p>

<h2>A quick look at the tool</h2>

<p><center><img src="../../Images/DashboardOverview.png"></center></p>

<P>The Process Dashboard attempts to keep itself as small as possible to save 
valuable screen real estate for the actual work of software development.  In 
a very small space the dashboard gives access to a stopwatch-like timer for 
timing activities, a defect entry dialog for capturing defect information, 
scripts and forms for following defined processes, a handy 
"completion checkbox" that allows a quick and easy way to tell the tool that a 
phase of development is complete, menus that allow navigation through the 
project work breakdown structure hierarchy, and a configuration menu to allow 
access to other features of the tool.</P>
