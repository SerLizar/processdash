<H1><a name="para_1_"></a>1. Quick Overview</H1>

<P>We feel that the PSP<sup>(SM)</sup> and the 
TSP<sup>(SM)</sup> are remarkable technologies that can
change the face of the software industry, and we share the SEI's zeal to 
promote their widespread use. We feel that a freely available, powerful 
support tool could help to remove one of the most significant barriers to PSP 
/ TSP adoption. We therefore aim to develop a world-class tool under the 
open-source model, and distribute it freely to anyone using the PSP and/or 
TSP.  We feel that this is the least we can do to thank the SEI for 
developing and distributing these remarkable processes.</P>

<p class="ifpsp">You have installed an add-on module which

<h2><a name="para_1_1_"></a>1.1. A quick look at the tool</h2>

<p><center><img src="Images/DashboardOverview.png"></center></p>

<P>The Process Dashboard attempts to keep itself as small as possible to save 
valuable screen real estate for the actual work of software development.  In 
a very small space the dashboard gives access to a stopwatch-like timer for 
timing activities, a defect entry dialog for capturing defect information, 
scripts and forms for following defined processes, a handy 
"completion checkbox" that allows a quick and easy way to tell the tool that a 
phase of development is complete, menus that allow navigation through the 
project work breakdown structure hierarchy, and a configuration menu to allow 
access to other features of the tool.</P>

<h2><a name="para_1_2_"></a>1.2. The dashboard and the web browser</h2>

<P>The Process Dashboard uses a web browser for the bulk of its data entry 
and reporting.  See the <a href="#doc13_top">Installation</A> help 
topic for more info about which web browsers are supported and how to install 
them if necessary.</P>

<P>The<a name="doc1_webServer"></a> connection between the dashboard and the 
browser is facilitated by a very small web server that is running within the 
dashboard.  It is this web server, combined with some Java scripting, that 
provides all the live data communication between the dashboard and the 
browser.  One consequence of this is that the various reports and charts that 
are displayed within the browser will not be available unless the dashboard 
is running.</P>

<H2><a name="para_1_3_"></a>1.3. <!--SEP--><a href="#doc23_top"><img border="0" class="sepnotice" src="Images/PSPDisclaimer.png"></a> <!--/SEP-->The process scripts</h2>

<P>An add-on module for the Process Dashboard provides nearly all
the scripts defined in <I>A Discipline for Software Engineering</i> by
Watts Humphrey.  In all cases, the forms and scripts were designed to
be as close to the "real thing" as possible (the "real thing" being
the forms and tables in Appendix C of Watts Humphrey's book).  Where
the online forms and scripts deviate, the text is color coded as
follows:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Where the dashboard makes a certain step unnecessary the text is colored 
   in grey (e.g. writing entries in a time log).</li>
 <li>Where the dashboard changes the way a certain step is performed, the 
   text is colored in green (e.g. using the PROBE tool or the PROBE wizard 
   instead of performing statistical calculations via a calculator or 
   spreadsheet).</li>
</ul>

<P>Many of the process forms contain links to other forms that are used at 
that process level, making navigation through the forms simple and 
intuitive.  Also, many of the process scripts contain little stopwatch icons 
on them.  These icons provide another way to navigate and time a process 
phase.  When you click on one of these icons, the current phase being 
measured will change to the phase indicated by the icon and the timer will 
start measuring time for that phase.</p>

<P>For information on how to access the forms, see the <a href="#doc39_top">Accessing process scripts</a> help 
topic.</p>

<p>The following lists detail the forms and scripts provided by the dashboard 
at each PSP level.  Items marked by <sup>*</sup> are "live" forms that either 
update themselves with process data (e.g. the project summary forms) or can 
be expanded as necessary to permit multiple data entry (e.g. the size 
estimating template or the PSP3 cycle summary form).</p>

<P>Starting at PSP level 2, the Project Plan Summary form gets large enough

<h3><a name="para_1_3_1_"></a>1.3.1. <A name="doc2_generic"></A>The "generic" process script</h3>
<P>Very much of the methodology that is employed by the PSP can be used in 
other endeavors.  Any kind of work that has measurable time, size, and/or
defects can probably benefit from a PSP-like process.  The generic process 
scripts attempt to give rudimentary measurement and defect tracking for other 
work efforts.</p>

<P>When you create a project based on the generic process in the <a href="#doc28_top">hierarchy editor</a>, it will
initially contain only a planning phase and a postmortem phase.  You can
then add additional phases (and give them any names that you want) by
selecting the node corresponding to the generic project, then selecting
"Generic Phase" from the "Add Template" menu:</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/ShowAddGenericPhase.png"></center></p>

<P>The generic process then creates a tailored project plan summary form.  It
allows entry of time and size estimates, and even lets you enter the unit of
size measurement.  For example, you could run the generic process to measure
and track your progress as you write a technical paper.  The size unit would
end up being something related to the work of writing (perhaps pages).  The
generic process would capture your productivity rates and allow you to enter
defects.  Estimation support would also be available through the PROBE
tool.</p>

<h3><a name="para_1_3_2_"></a>1.3.2. <A name="doc2_timer"></A>The "timer" process script</h3>
<P>The timer process allows for estimating and measuring activities that have 
only a time aspect to them.  If you regularly perform some kind of task that 
pretty much remains the same each time, you could record estimates and times 
for that task to attempt to provide some engineering discipline.</p>

<h3><a name="para_1_3_3_"></a>1.3.3. <A name="doc2_custom"></A>Custom process scripts</h3>

<P>The dashboard has been designed from the ground up to support custom
processes.  The PSP scripts and forms that you see are not hard-coded into the
tool; instead, they are dynamically loaded from simple HTML and text files.
Thus, it is possible to create your own custom process scripts, forms, and
data that will be dynamically integrated into the dashboard.

<P>More information on creating custom processes is available in the <a href="#doc55_top"> Advanced
Topics</a> section of the help.

<h3><a name="para_1_3_4_"></a>1.3.4. Custom process vs Generic process?</h3>

<P>When should you use the generic process, and when should you create a
custom process?  In general, you should use the generic process:</P>

<UL>
<LI>If the process for this task is unlikely to be reused in the future (for
example, because the task at hand is a departure from the work you normally
do).</LI>

<LI>If the process for this task is still immature and uncertain.  As you
begin creating your own custom process definitions, the flexibility of the
generic process will allow you to radically change your process from one task
to the next in response to process improvement proposals.  Once you decide
upon and finalize the <u>list of phases</u> in your process, you are ready to
begin using a custom process script.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The generic script gives you a lot of flexibility - the phase names and
other process specifics can change from task to task, or even in the middle of
a generic project!  This flexibility comes at a price, however: without an
unchanging process definition, it isn't possible to compare "apples to apples"
across numerous generic processes.  Therefore, the generic process cannot
calculate "to date" data like a custom process can.  On the other hand, a
change to your process definition can potentially invalidate all the
historical data you've collected, so it is best to wait and define a custom
process when you feel you've confidently identified its phases.</P>

<P>The first thing we need to do to get started is to create a new PSP1.1 
project in the dashboard.  To do that, we will start the hierarchy editor by 
choosing Hierarchy from the <a href="#doc45_top">Configure
menu</a>.</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/QSHierarchyEditorBefore.png"></center></p>

<P>We need to decide where to place this project in our work breakdown 
structure.  At this point, we can see the various other projects that have 
been worked on previously (a PSP course).</p>

<P>We will place our PSP1.1 project under the "Project" node like the others.
To do that we will select the "Project" node by clicking it once. Next we will 
pick the "Edit" menu and choose "Add Template" followed by "PSP1.1". This will
add a PSP1.1-based project to the project hierarchy as a child of "Project". 
When the new project is added, it is given a default name.  We can change the 
name to better describe what we are working on.  In this case, we will follow 
the pattern shown and name the project "5A".  For more information on using 
the hierarchy editor, see the <a href="#doc28_top">Using the hierarchy editor</a>
help topic.</P>

<P>Once the project has been created and renamed, click on the little 
expansion control to the left of the 5A project to expand its child nodes in

<P>Now that the project exists, we can start the planning of our work.  The 
PSP provides scripts for planning, development, postmortem work, etc., so 
let's go look at the planning script for our new PSP1.1 project.  This is done 
by selecting our newly created project via the hierarchy menus (the dashboard 
will automatically select the planning phase -- the first development phase 
of a PSP1.1 project), then clicking the scripts button.  We should also click 
the play button on the dashboard to start timing our planning activities.  
When the play button is pressed, a quiet "clicking" sound will be heard.  
This sound will be heard anytime the dashboard switches phases of activity 
while the clock is running.</p>

<P align="center"><img src="Images/QSChoosingPlanning.png"></p>

<P>The dashboard responds by bringing up the PSP1.1 planning script in a web 
browser.  Reading through the script, we see that once we understand the 
requirements for program 5A, we need to do a size estimate.  To guide our 
estimation, we can use the PROBE method.  Following the <U>PROBE method</u>
link on the planning script brings up the PROBE Estimating Script.</p>

<p>Reading through this script we see that once we have produced a conceptual 
design, we need to fill out the Size Estimating Template.  The dashboard 
provides both the template itself and the instruction script for its use.  
Following the link for the <U>Size Estimating Template</u> brings up a 
dynamic HTML version of the template.  For ready reference, the template has 
a link near the top to display the Size Estimating Template instructions 
form.  If you click on this link, a second browser will be started so that 
you can have the instructions and the template side by side on your screen.  
For more information on the Size Estimating Template, see the <a href="#doc29_top">Size Estimating 
Template</a> help topic.</p>

<p class="ifpsp" align="center"><img src="Images/QSShowSizeEstimatingTemplateTop.png"></p>

<P>The Size Estimating Template Instructions direct us to count the base LOC 
and enter it at entry B if this is an enhancement of a previous program.  
Program 5A is a new program, so the whole base program LOC and base additions 
sections don't apply.  We will leave those entries with their default values 
of 0.</p>

<P>New objects will be a place for most of our estimating.  The student who 
produced the data used for this example estimated that 5 new objects would be 
created.  Their types, number of methods, and LOC estimates are entered under 
the new objects section of the form.  The "add more rows for new objects"
link will expand the form with more entries if chosen.</p>

<P>The student who worked this problem did not have any entries for the 
reused objects section of the form, so we will skip that section as well.</P>

<P>Moving on to the size calculation, we need to calculate the estimated new 
&amp; changed LOC using PROBE. There are at least two ways to do this: with
the PROBE Wizard or with the PROBE tool. (The PROBE Wizard automates
the standard PSP PROBE process, and is simpler to use; the PROBE tool is
more complex to use but provides more power for custom statistical
analyses). For this example, we will use the PROBE Wizard. After you
complete the top portion of the Size Estimating Template, you can launch
the PROBE wizard by clicking on the hyperlink halfway down the page.</P>

<p class="ifpsp" align="center"><img src="Images/ProbeWizardLink.png"></p>

<P>The PROBE Wizard consists of a series of dialogs that guide you through 
the PROBE process.</P>

<p align="center"><img src="Images/QSProbeWizardStartup.png"></p>

<P>The PROBE script gives several ways to calculate an estimate. The PROBE
Wizard displays these methods side by side and ranks them, advising us
which method may be the most reliable. By simply following the prompts, we
decide in this example to select method C2 for size and then choose C2 for
time. As we make these choices, the resulting values are automatically
written into the appropriate fields of the Size Estimating Template.</p>

<p class="ifpsp">After our planning efforts on this form it looks like
the following:</p>

<p class="ifpsp" align="center"><img src="Images/QSSizeEstimatingTemplateDone.png"></p>

<P>When we bring up the Project Plan Summary, we see that the planning data 
is all entered automatically.  Time to click the little done button on the 
dashboard and move on into design!</p>

<p align="center"><img src="Images/QSFinishPlanning.png"></p>

<P>Note also that when the dashboard moves into a new phase while the timer 
is running, a little "clicking" noise is made.  This little bit of feedback 
assures us that the timer is still running.</p>

on the scripts button.  Pressing the pull-down will bring up a menu of the 
scripts and forms available for the project.  Picking a script or form from
the menu will open that form in a web browser.  In this case, picking
&quot;PSP1.1 Development Script&quot; will take us to the development
script.</p>

<p>While designing program 5A, we will be sure to keep the dashboard's timer 
running.  This can be confirmed by noticing the state of the play/pause 
button.  For more information on the play/pause button, see the <a href="#doc40_top">play/pause button</a> help topic.</P>

<P>Once finished with the program design, we move on to the coding phase by 
clicking the completion checkbox again.</p>

<P>While compiling the program, many people will find that they have injected 
a defect during the previous phases.  Such was the case for this program as 
well.</p>

<P>To enter a defect, click the defect button.</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/QSDefectButton.png"></center></p>

<P>The first defect found by the student on this program was due to a syntax 
error.  The defect dialog looks for this defect looks like the following:</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/QSEnterDefect1.png"></center></p>

<P>The defect dialog allows entry of all the pertinent data about a defect.  
For more information about entering defects into the dashboard, see the <a href="#doc43_top">Entering Defects</a> help topic.</p>

<p>Of course, there were more defects found during compile, but we won't show

<P>The testing phase is another phase that typically finds many defects.  
Since we have already seen an entry of a defect, we will take this 
opportunity to look at a more complicated situation.</p>

<P>Consider the following circumstance: you find a defect and put in a fix.  
Upon compiling your fix you discover that you have inadvertently injected 
another defect (perhaps a syntax error in your coding).  This is what the PSP 
calls a "fix defect" -- a defect injected while entering a fix for another 
defect.</p>

<P>The dashboard has a very handy feature to help in this regard.  While the 
defect dialog for one defect is open, you can click on the little defect 
button in the corner to enter a new defect for the fix of the current 
defect.</p>

<P><center><img src="Images/QSPointToFixDefectButton.png"></center></p>

<P>After clicking the Fix Defect button, a new defect dialog will open for 
entry of data for this new defect.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/QSTwoDefectDialogs.png"></center></p>

<P>While this new defect dialog is open, the timer for the previous defect 
dialog is paused.  Also, notice that the number of the previous defect is 
already entered in the Fix Defect blank.  Once the information for this new 
defect is entered and the user clicks OK, the previous defect dialog will pop 
to the front of the screen and the timer will resume.  For more information 
about this behavior, see the <a href="#doc43_top">Entering Defects</a> help topic.</p>

<P>Back to our example.  Once the program has been sufficiently tested and 
all the defects have been entered, hit the completion checkbox again to move 
into Postmortem.</p>

<P>The PSP provides Postmortem scripts for all of the PSP levels.  To get to 
the postmortem for the current program, we can click the link at the bottom 
of the development script.  Also, clicking the script button on the dashboard 
while in the postmortem phase will bring up the postmortem script, or using 
the pull-down control on the scripts button will display an option for the postmortem script as well.</p>

<P>After making sure that the entry criteria are met, the next step that must 
be done is to enter the actual size data for the program.  Actual values for 
base, deleted, modified, total, base additions, new and reused LOC can be 
entered on the Size Estimating Template form, which can be reached by 
clicking the appropriate link from the postmortem script. The data entered 
into the Size Estimating Template will automatically be reflected in the 
Project Plan Summary form, as well.</p>

<p class="ifpsp" align="center"><img src="Images/QSEnterActualLOC.png"></p>

<P>Once the actual size information (including measures of reuse) has been 
entered on the Size Estimating Template form, we can mark the postmortem 
phase complete. Once all the phases in the process have been marked 
complete, the dashboard will mark the project itself complete as well.  We 
can double check that it has been marked by looking at the Project Completion 
checkbox on the Project Plan Summary.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="Images/QSCheckProjectComplete.png"></p>

<p>If the Project Complete checkbox had not been automatically checked, it 
would indicate that we had already overridden this automatic behavior.  You 
can learn more about the relationship between marking the phases complete and 
marking the entire project complete by reading the <a href="#doc41_top">Using the completion checkbox</a>
help topic.</p>

<p class="ifpsp">At the end of this project, the entire Project Plan
Summary form looks like this.</p>

<P class="ifpsp" align="center"><img src="Images/QSProjectPlanSummary.png"></p>

<P>The Process Dashboard also offers several other aids for analyzing 
postmortem data.  Choosing Data Analysis from the "C" menu will open the web 
browser to a set of pages that contain many useful graphs of process data.</P>

<p align="center"><img src="Images/QSDataAnalysis.png"></p>

<P>This Data Analysis page provides several different categories of charts to 
allow easy analysis of various metrics measured in the PSP.  Clicking on one 
of the chart thumbnails in the right pane will bring up a full-sized view of 
that chart.  For more information on the types of data that can be analyzed 
via these reports and graphs, see the <a href="#doc48_top">Creating Reports and 
Charts</a> help topic.</p>

<P>That's it for this example.  We hope it has been helpful.</p>

<H2><a name="para_1_5_"></a>1.5. Overall goals</H2>

<P>We feel that the PSP and the TSP are remarkable technologies that
can change the face of the software industry, and we share the SEI's
zeal to promote their widespread use. We feel that a freely available,
powerful support tool could help to remove one of the most significant
barriers to PSP / TSP adoption. We therefore aim to develop a
world-class tool under the open-source model, and distribute it freely
to anyone using the PSP and/or TSP. We feel that this is the least we
can do to thank the SEI for developing and distributing these
remarkable processes. </P>

<a name="doc11_psp"></a><H3><a name="para_1_5_1_"></a>1.5.1. What is the PSP<sup>(SM)</sup>?</H3>

<P>The Personal Software Process<sup>(SM)</sup>, created by Watts
Humphrey of the Software Engineering Institute, introduces software
engineers to a disciplined process for software engineering. Engineers
using the PSP to develop software follow defined processes and collect
detailed metrics on the time required to produce a product, the
defects that were injected and removed at various stages in
development, and the size of the finished product.</P>

<P>These metrics are then analyzed using statistical methods, enabling 
engineers to produce highly accurate estimates based on historical data, 
track progress and quality of a project in progress, predict schedule 
impacts, and predict the quality of a finished software product. The PSP 
encourages engineers to quantitatively determine ways to improve their 
process.</P>

<P>For more information on the PSP, see the official PSP website at 
<U>http://www.sei.cmu.edu/tsp</u>, maintained by Carnegie Mellon 
University.</P>

<a name="doc11_tsp"></a><H3><a name="para_1_5_2_"></a>1.5.2. What is the TSP<sup>(SM)</sup>?</H3>

<P>The Team Software Process<sup>(SM)</sup>, also
created by Watts Humphrey, is a process framework for teams of
PSP-trained engineers. The TSP scales well and can be used by teams of
3 to 20 people to develop software products of significant size and
complexity.</P>

<P>Teams of engineers using both the PSP and the TSP to develop software have 
consistently observed remarkable improvements in their work:</P>

<UL>
 <LI>End-to-end productivity improvements of 20% - 150%</li>
 <LI>99% reductions in system test defects, and virtually defect-free 
   released software.</li>
 <LI>Schedule estimates accurate to within 10% (4% error on average)</LI>
</UL>

<H3><a name="para_1_5_3_"></a>1.5.3. Why build a tool?</H3>

<P>Both the PSP and the TSP require the collection and analysis of metrics at 
a <I>very</I> fine-grained level. Further, TSP requires teams to roll-up 
individual metrics to produce team metrics. Once data are collected at this 
level, statistical analyses of the data permit remarkable planning, tracking, 
prediction, and control of software products and projects.</P>

<P>These metrics collection and analysis processes, however, are not trivial. 
In any real-world project, tool support for the PSP and TSP become important 
considerations. Although studies have demonstrated that people <U>can</U>
maintain their productivity when using the PSP <I>without</I> tool support, 
the "frustration factor" inherent with such an approach tries the patience of 
all but the most disciplined engineers, making PSP behaviors difficult to 
sustain.</P>

<P>Ideally, PSP/TSP practitioners would like to have a support tool that:</P>

<UL>
 <LI>Allows data at the personal level to be collected quickly and easily, 
   with minimal frustration.</li>
 <LI>Can be integrated with existing development environments and project 
   management tools.</li>
 <LI>Allows individuals to collaborate on the execution of a process (even if 
   they are geographically distributed).</li>
 <LI>Allows data at the individual level to be rolled up to produce 
   team-level or organizational-level metrics.</li>
 <LI>Protects the privacy of individuals, and prevents unauthorized people 
   from seeing or using their data.</li>
 <LI>Supports powerful analyses of data at the individual, team, 
   organizational, and enterprise levels, and allows existing (external) 
   applications to access the data (while still maintaining the security 
   mentioned above).</li>
 <LI>Supports arbitrary processes (including processes that have yet to be 
   written), and arbitrary new process tools.</LI>
</UL>

<P>This initiative aims to develop an open-source tool to meet all of these 
needs.</P>

<P>Development on the dashboard is ongoing. To see the list of features 
currently supported / being worked on, select the "Coming Soon" link on our 
web site: <u>http://processdash.sourceforge.net</u>.</P>

<H2><a name="para_1_6_"></a>1.6. Using help</H2>

<p>Starting the help system is as easy as clicking "help" on the "C"
(configure) menu.  This online help is available via two methods:<ul>

   <li>If you have JavaHelp<sup>TM</sup> installed on your computer,
       the dashboard will use it to provide context-sensitive help
       with an index and full-text search capabilities.</li>

   <li>If JavaHelp is not present on your computer, the dashboard will
       display help topics in your web browser.</li>

</ul>

<p>The full-text search capability is a very useful feature; for this
reason, we strongly recommend installing JavaHelp.  The 
<a href="#doc13_top">installer program</a>
for the Process Dashboard can automatically download and install the
JavaHelp software if you select that option.  The paragraphs below
describe the behavior of the help when JavaHelp has been
installed.</p>

<P>Currently the help system provides three ways of accessing help topics:</P>
<UL>
 <LI>A table of contents view</LI>
 <LI>An index view</LI>
 <LI>A search engine view</LI>
</UL>

<P>These three views are accessed via the three tabs at the top of the left 
screen pane.</P>

<h3><a name="para_1_6_1_"></a>1.6.1. The Table of Contents view</h3>
<P>The table of contents provides a hierarchical organization of the help 
topics.  Items that are shown as books represent logical groupings of help 
topics and can be clicked to reveal more detailed help.</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/ShowHelpTOC.png"></center></p>

<h3><a name="para_1_6_2_"></a>1.6.2. The Index view</h3>
<P>The index view provides an alphabetical listing of various keywords on 
which to find help.</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/ShowHelpIndex.png"></center></p>

<h3><a name="para_1_6_3_"></a>1.6.3. <a name="doc12_search"></a>The Search Engine view</h3>
<P>The search engine view provides an entry blank where you can enter 
words you would like the help system to search for within the help topics.  
After entering search criteria you will be presented with a list of help 
topics that contained the word or words entered.  To the left of each item 
will be a number indicating how many times the word(s) entered were found in 
that particular help topic.</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/ShowHelpSearch.png"></center></p>

<h3><a name="para_1_6_4_"></a>1.6.4. The navigation buttons</h3>
<P>The help viewer also provides two navigation buttons at the top left.  
They allow for the familiar "back" and "forward" functionalities that are so 
common in modern web browsers.</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/ShowHelpNavigationButtons.png"></center></p>

<h3><a name="para_1_6_5_"></a>1.6.5. The print buttons</h3>
<p>The two buttons to the right of the navigation buttons are a "Print Topic"
button and a "Page Setup" button.  These buttons allow you to print a help 
topic for later reading.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/ShowHelpPrintButtons.png"></center></p>

<h3><a name="para_1_6_6_"></a>1.6.6. Context sensitive help</h3>
<P>There is also some context sensitive help available.  If you press the F1 
key while viewing the dashboard itself or one of its tools (PROBE, time log 
editor, etc.), the dashboard will startup a help screen pertinent to that 
tool.</p>

<H3><a name="para_1_7_1_"></a>1.7.1. System Requirements</H3>

<P>The Process Dashboard is 100% Java, and will run on any system with a Java 
2 compliant virtual machine. This includes Windows, Linux, Unix,
and Macintosh systems. For access to forms and scripts, a supported web
browser is also required.</p>

<P>To use the process dashboard, you must <b>first</b> install the following 
software:</P>

<UL>
 <LI><a name="doc13_jre">The Java Runtime Environment, version 1.4 or
   greater (available from Sun Microsystems at
   <u>http://www.java.com/</u>)</li>

 <LI>Make certain that JavaScript is enabled in your web browser.
   (This is typically the default setting, so you usually don't need
   to worry about enabling these unless you explicitly disabled them
   in the past.)</li>

 <LI>If you connect to the internet via a proxy server, you may need to tell 
   your browser to bypass the proxy for the address "localhost". The 
   instructions below may not apply to your browser word-for-word, but should 
   hopefully get you pointed in the right direction:
  <UL>
   <LI>For Internet Explorer, choose &quot;Tools <IMG BORDER="0" SRC="Images/rarrow.png" WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="9"> Internet 
      Options&quot;. Click on the "Connections" tab, then on the "LAN
      Settings" button. Make certain the "Bypass proxy server for
      local addresses" box is <B><STRONG>checked</STRONG></B>.</li>

   <LI>For Firefox, no changes are typically necessary.  If you have
    trouble viewing dashboard scripts and forms, choose &quot;Tools
    <IMG BORDER="0" SRC="Images/rarrow.png" WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="9">
    Options&quot;.  Under the "General" category, click the
    "Connection Settings" button, and ensure that the
    "No Proxy for" box contains "localhost".</LI>

<H2><a name="para_1_8_"></a>1.8. Change History</H2>

<h3><a name="para_1_8_1_"></a>1.8.1. Features new in version 1.7</h3>

<ul>

 <li>The Process Dashboard now integrates with a wide variety of web
   browsers on all platforms.  In particular, Unix/Linux users no
   longer need to use an older version of Netscape to view dashboard
   forms.</li>

 <li>It is now possible to export a snapshot of the Data Analysis 
   center for your personal data.</li>

 <li>The Data Analysis center has been enhanced to support custom
   processes.  Users who define a custom process will see customized
   versions of Report 3, 4, and 5 for their process.</li>

 <li>New wizards for importing and exporting data can assist with
   the rollup of team project metrics.</li>

 <li>The Process Dashboard now contains extensive support for
   internationalization.  A Localization Tool is provided to help
   users translate dashboard messages into their native language, and
   share those translations with other users.</li>

</ul>


<h3><a name="para_1_8_2_"></a>1.8.2. Features new in version 1.6</h3>

<ul>

 <li>The dashboard contains several innovative enhancements to earned
   value functionality:<ul>

   <li>The earned value tool in the dashboard can now calculate
     estimated prediction intervals for forecast completion date and
     forecast cost.  These intervals compare your planned progress to
     your actual progress using numerical methods and approximate
     pivotal statistics, computing a range of dates within which your
     project is likely to finish.  The dashboard can calculate these
     ranges both for individual earned value schedules and for
     rolled-up team schedules.</li>

   <li>Traditional PSP earned value planning addresses only
     &quot;direct time,&quot; omitting time spent on recurring
     activities (such as weekly meetings) and ongoing activities (such
     as communicating with customers and management, or participating
     on committees).  Unfortunately, &quot;direct time&quot; is an
     unfamiliar metric for many organizations, which are accustomed to
     tracking &quot;project time&quot; instead. As a result, senior
     managers in some organizations take issue with earned value plans
     that reflect only 15-20 direct hours per week.<br>

     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help development teams
     avoid this potential misunderstanding, the dashboard now provides
     an innovative new feature: &quot;level of effort&quot; tasks can
     be added to earned value task lists.  Although these tasks don't
     affect the earned value calculations, they do allow you to create
     a schedule that accounts for all of your &quot;project time&quot;
     - and this can help when you present plans to management for
     approval.  To add &quot;level of effort&quot; tasks to an earned
     value plan, just enter percentages for these tasks in the
     &quot;planned time&quot; column instead of durations.  (Planned
     direct time for the periods in the schedule is then calculated
     automatically by reducing the planned total time by the
     appropriate percentage.)  To help you enhance the accuracy of
     future estimates, &quot;actual time&quot; for &quot;level of
     effort&quot; tasks is also displayed as a percentage.</li>

   <li>Earned value task lists in the dashboard have always been
     hierarchically organized.  When the list of tasks for a
     particular project differs from the structure of your dashboard
     hierarchy, new features in the earned value tool allow you to
     &quot;prune&quot; and reorder tasks to better describe the work
     that needs to be done.</li>

   <li>At times in the middle of a project, you may decide that you
     wish to &quot;re-plan&quot; the remaining tasks and start with a
     fresh earned value schedule.  The dashboard now makes this
     simple: just change the starting date on your earned value
     schedule to the current date.  All work performed before the
     starting date of the schedule will be factored out of earned
     value calculations automatically.</li>

 </ul></li>

 <li>The &quot;Data Analysis&quot; center now allows you to generate
   custom charts and reports, simply by selecting options from
   drop-down lists.  The data in these custom charts and reports can
   also be exported to Excel for further custom analysis.</li>

 <li>The time log now includes a column for the entry of optional
   comments.</li>

 <li>It is now possible to create and edit custom defect type
   standards.</li>

</ul>


<h3><a name="para_1_8_3_"></a>1.8.3. Features new in version 1.5 (released October 3, 2002)</h3>
<ul>
 <li>The dashboard is now compatible with version 1.4 and higher of
   the Java Runtime Environment.</li>

 <li>The dashboard now contains support for Netscape 6 and higher on
   Windows platforms, and is also compatible with the Sun Java Plug-in
   in Internet Explorer.</li>

 <li>The task and schedule planning tool now contains built-in support
   for collaboration! You can share your schedules with your
   co-workers, your manager, and/or your customer, and keep them
   up-to-date on your progress.  If you are working on a project with
   other people, you can roll up your individual schedules to create
   an earned value schedule for the project.</li>

 <li>The task and schedule planning tool helps you to avoid several
   common planning mistakes.</li>

 <li>The hierarchy editor now includes a toolbar to facilitate the
  editing of your work breakdown structure.</li>

 <li>Numerous user interface enhancements make the hierarchy editor,
   the time log editor, and the defect log editor easier to use.</li>

</ul>

<h3><a name="para_1_8_4_"></a>1.8.4. Features new in version 1.4 (released February 22, 2002)</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Creating custom processes has never been easier - now you can create  
   your own process definitions for use with the dashboard by writing a simple 
   XML file.</li>

 <li>Task and schedule features help you to track your work using earned 
   value, and calculate forecasts for cost and schedule.</li>

 <li>New "data rollup" templates allow you to roll-up data from
   multiple projects. This feature makes it possible to:
  <ul>
   <li>Roll up psp data to the project level.</li>
   <li>Create multiple subsets of "To Date" data (for example, representing 
      different programming languages). The "To Date" data mechanism now 
      allows you to select, for each project, which subset should be used for 
      automatic calculations.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li>External documents are now integrated into the process scripts - click 
   on hyperlinks for documents like the PIP form, the Issue Tracking Log, 
   etc. and the appropriate document will be opened for the project you're 
   working on.</li>

 <li>A new "PROBE Wizard" simplifies the PROBE process, and provides advice 
   on which PROBE method is most appropriate.</li>

 <li>You can now export forms (like the Project Plan Summary or the Size 
   Estimating Template) to Excel for additional, custom analysis. If you want 
   to show your data to others, or save copies of forms for project 
   documentation, you can also export these forms to static HTML 
   documents.</li>

 <li>You can now "unlock" the read-only data on forms if you want to override 
   any of the calculations that the dashboard automatically performs for 
   you.</li>

 <li>The hierarchy editor now allows you to move nodes/projects. Cut and paste 
   operations make it possible to reorganize your work breakdown structure.</li>

 <li>The drop-down list on the script button now displays choices like 
   "Project Plan Summary" instead of listing the names of process phases. In 
   addition, a "script browser" makes it easy to open a script/form for any 
   project in your hierarchy without needing to navigate to that project 
   first.</li>

 <li>Checkmarks in the hierarchy menus make it easy to see which phases / 
   projects have been marked complete.</li>

 <li>The "pspdiff" program (which calculates added / deleted / modified 
   physical LOC counts) is now incorporated into the dashboard.</li>

 <li>A major overhaul of the internal data calculation engine allows the 
   dashboard to recalculate data up to 10 times faster.</li>

 <li>If you insert "Design Review" or "Code Review" phases into a PSP0 - 
   PSP1.1 project, these phases will automatically appear on the project plan 
   summary and in the process scripts.</li>

 <li>The text "ERROR" in the dashboard forms has been changed to "#VALUE!" or 
   "#DIV/0!" to behave more like Excel.</li>

 <li>An entry to enter the Total LOC was added to the Size Estimating 
   Template screen.  This only makes sense since you have to enter nearly all 
   other actual LOC measures on this form.</li>

 <li>Help was implemented via a sub menu.  Other items on the Help sub menu 
   allow you to submit bug reports online and navigate to the user online 
   help forum.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="para_1_8_5_"></a>1.8.5. Features new in version 1.3.1 (released August 14, 2001)</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Version 1.3.1 was released to address a high-priority bug present in 
   version 1.3.  No significant new features were added to 1.3 for this 
   release.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="para_1_8_6_"></a>1.8.6. Features new in version 1.3 (released July 16, 2001)</h3>

<ul>
 <li>The dashboard now includes greatly enhanced online help! Improved help 
   has been the #1 requested feature by you, the user community. We are 
   therefore pleased to offer indexed, searchable online help with ten times 
   the content of version 1.2.</li>

 <li>The dashboard now includes a "Generic" process.  When you use the 
   generic process to perform a task, it allows you to:
  <ul>
   <li>Choose any list of phases, with custom names</li>
   <li>Decide whether or not it makes sense to track defects for the task</li>
   <li>Decide whether or not it makes sense to measure size for the task, and 
      choose a custom unit of size measurement.</li>
  </ul>

  The dashboard then provides a customized Project Plan Summary Form for your 
   custom process.</li>

 <li>The dashboard now contains a mechanism for freezing baselined data. When 
   you mark the planning phase of a project complete, all the data in the 
   "Plan" column of the Project Plan Summary form will freeze and stop 
   recalculating. Similarly, when you mark the project complete, all the data 
   in the "To Date" column will freeze and stop recalculating. This makes it 
   possible to view the report again in the future without having the numbers 
   changing in the report.</li>

 <li>The dashboard can now notify you when updates are released, either to 
   the dashboard itself or to the add-on process sets you have installed.</li>

 <li>The PROBE tool now contains a drop-down box for quickly exploring PROBE 
   methods A, B, and C.</li>

 <li>The Play/Pause button now has a drop-down menu for quickly jumping to a 
   task where you have recently logged time. If you often bounce back and 
   forth between tasks for different projects, this feature makes your life 
   easier.</li>

 <li>Numerous bug fixes make the Time Log Editor more robust.</li>

 <li>The Time Log Editor now makes it easy to quickly filter your view of the 
   time log to "Today", "This Week", or "This Month". Forward and backward 
   buttons let you scroll to look at different time periods.</li>

 <li>The play/pause button and the hierarchy menus now provide audible 
   feedback to help you keep track of whether the dashboard is timing or 
   paused.</li>

 <li>The previous version of the dashboard would only write entries to the 
   time log when you changed phases; now, the time log is updated 
   continually. The data in your time log and your project plan summary forms 
   is never more than a minute old.</li>

 <li>When you find yourself fixing several defects at once (which can happen 
   often due to "fix defects" and "related defects"), the dashboard provides 
   better assistance.  It automatically ensures that only one defect timer is 
   running at a time, and maintains a stack of "interrupted" defects.</li>

 <li>The Defect Log Editor now allows defects to be deleted. It also supports 
   quick filtering to see the defects which were injected or removed in a 
   given phase.</li>

 <li>Timer icons have been placed on the HTML forms to allow navigation among 
   the phases of development without having to reach all the way up to the 
   hierarchy menus.</li>

 <li>A method was added that will allow driving of the dashboard by another 
   program.  This will allow IDE developers to add support for the 
   dashboard from within their programming environments.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="para_1_8_7_"></a>1.8.7. Features new in version 1.2 (released April 20, 2001)</h3>

<ul>
 <li>The dashboard now includes support for ALL the standard PSP processes 
   (PSP0, PSP0.1, PSP1.0, PSP1.1, PSP2.0, PSP2.1, and PSP3.0). All of the 
   online PSP process scripts and forms have been edited to conform as 
   closely as possible to the originals in the PSP book.</li>

 <li>The dashboard now displays charts and reports! Choose the "Data Analysis"
   option on the "C" menu, and dozens of standard charts and reports are 
   available (including ALL the tables required by reports R3, R4, and R5, 
   and ALL the charts currently drawn by the SEI's "Student Workbook" Excel 
   spreadsheet). With a single click, export data to Excel for further 
   analysis.</li>

 <li>The PROBE tool is now simpler to use. Previously, it would allow you to 
   explore the correlation between any two data items; unfortunately, this 
   made it cumbersome for everyday use. Now, by default, it only displays the 
   data items traditionally used by the PSP PROBE methodology.</li>

 <li>The PSP0 - PSP1.1 processes now support optional "Design Review" and 
   "Code Review" phases.</li>

 <li>Errors in several calculations have been corrected. Also, the "To Date"
   data calculations have been completely revamped and are now working 
   properly.</li>

 <li>Data calculation efficiency has been improved.</li>

 <li>With the addition of the standard PSP processes, the SCR/DCR processes 
   are no longer shipped with the dashboard. If are a current dashboard user, 
   and you have been using the SCR/DCR processes, your existing SCR/DCR 
   projects WILL still work. If you wish to continue creating projects that 
   use the SCR/DCR processes in the future, please download the SCR/DCR 
   process separately.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="para_1_8_8_"></a>1.8.8. Features new in version 1.1 (released February 9, 2001)</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Version 1.1 contained enhancements that made the tool significantly 
   easier to install.</li>

<P>Version 2, June 1991</P>

<P>Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA</p>

<P>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>




<h4 NO_NUMBER>Preamble</H4>

<P>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

</P>
<P>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

</P>
<P>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

</P>
<P>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

</P>
<P>
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

</P>
<P>
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

</P>
<P>
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

</P>
<P>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

</P>


<h4 NO_NUMBER>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</H4>


<P>

<STRONG>0.</STRONG>
 This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<P>

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

<P>

<STRONG>1.</STRONG>
 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.
<P>

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<P>

<STRONG>2.</STRONG>
 You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<P>

<UL>

<LI><STRONG>a)</STRONG>
     You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

<P>
<LI><STRONG>b)</STRONG>
     You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
     parties under the terms of this License.

<P>
<LI><STRONG>c)</STRONG>
     If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
     notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
     a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
     these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
     License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
     does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
     the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
</UL>

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<P>

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.
<P>

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

<P>

<STRONG>3.</STRONG>
 You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:


<!-- we use this doubled UL to get the sub-sections indented, -->
<!-- while making the bullets as unobvious as possible. -->
<UL>

<LI><STRONG>a)</STRONG>
     Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

<P>
<LI><STRONG>b)</STRONG>
     Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
     cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
     customarily used for software interchange; or,

<P>
<LI><STRONG>c)</STRONG>
     Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
     to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
     received the program in object code or executable form with such
     an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
</UL>

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.
<P>

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
<P>

<STRONG>4.</STRONG>
 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

<P>

<STRONG>5.</STRONG>
 You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

<P>

<STRONG>6.</STRONG>
 Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

<P>

<STRONG>7.</STRONG>
 If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
<P>

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.
<P>

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.
<P>

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

<P>

<STRONG>8.</STRONG>
 If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

<P>

<STRONG>9.</STRONG>
 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.
<P>

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

 If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

<h4 NO_NUMBER>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</H4>

<P> If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</P>

<P>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</P>


<P><VAR>one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.</VAR><br>

<P>This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2

<P>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.</p>

<P>You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software

<P>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>

<P>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:</P>

Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'

<P>
The hypothetical commands <SAMP>`show w'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`show c'</SAMP> should show
the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than <SAMP>`show w'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`show c'</SAMP>; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever
suits your program.

</P>
<P>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]
</PRE>


<h4 NO_NUMBER>Preamble</H4>

<P>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
<P>
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
<P>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.
<P>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
<P>
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<P>
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
<P>
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.
<P>
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
<P>
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.
<P>
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.
<P>
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.
<P>
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
<P>
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.
<P>
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.
<P>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.
<P>

<h4 NO_NUMBER>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</H4>


<P>
<STRONG>0.</STRONG>
This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<P>
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
<P>
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)
<P>
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.
<P>
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.
<P>
<STRONG>1.</STRONG>
You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.
<P>
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.
<P>
<STRONG>2.</STRONG>
You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<P>
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>a)</STRONG>
       The modified work must itself be a software library.
  <LI><STRONG>b)</STRONG>
       You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
       stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

  <LI><STRONG>c)</STRONG>
       You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
       charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

  <LI><STRONG>d)</STRONG>
       If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
       table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
       the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
       is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
       in the event an application does not supply such function or
       table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
       its purpose remains meaningful.
       <P>
       (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
       a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
       application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
       application-supplied function or table used by this function must
       be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
       root function must still compute square roots.)
       <P>
       These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
       identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
       and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
       themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
       sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
       distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
       on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
       this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
       entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
       it.
       <P>
       Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
       your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
       exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
       collective works based on the Library.
       <P>
       In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
       with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
       a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
       the scope of this License.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>3.</STRONG>
You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.
<P>
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
<P>
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.
<P>
<STRONG>4.</STRONG>
You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.
<P>
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
<P>
<STRONG>5.</STRONG>
A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
<P>
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
<P>
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
<P>
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)
<P>
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
<P>
<STRONG>6.</STRONG>
As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.
<P>
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:
<P>
<UL>
    <LI><STRONG>a)</STRONG> Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    <LI><STRONG>b)</STRONG> Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

    <LI><STRONG>c)</STRONG> Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    <LI><STRONG>d)</STRONG> If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    <LI><STRONG>e)</STRONG> Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
</UL>
<P>
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.
<P>
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.
<P>
<STRONG>7.</STRONG> You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
<P>
<UL>
    <LI><STRONG>a)</STRONG> Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    <LI><STRONG>b)</STRONG> Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>8.</STRONG> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
<P>
<STRONG>9.</STRONG>
You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.
<P>
<STRONG>10.</STRONG>
Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.
<P>
<STRONG>11.</STRONG>
If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
<P>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
<P>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.
<P>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.
<P>
<STRONG>12.</STRONG>
If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.
<P>
<STRONG>13.</STRONG>
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<P>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.
<P>
<STRONG>14.</STRONG>
If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.
<P>
<STRONG>NO WARRANTY</STRONG>
<P>
<STRONG>15.</STRONG>
BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<P>
<STRONG>16.</STRONG>
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF

DAMAGES.

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).
<P>
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<P>

<h3><a name="para_1_9_8_"></a>1.9.8. PSP<sup>(SM)</sup> Process Distribution</h3>

<p>The Process Dashboard is a general-purpose tool designed to support
the enactment of any defined process.  It is especially useful for
supporting metrics-intensive, high-maturity processes.  Although the
dashboard is best known for its support of the Personal Software
Process<sup>(SM)</sup> (PSP), it can be used just as effectively with
any defined process.  In addition, many features of the dashboard,
such as the earned value tracking tool, can be used independently of a
defined process.</p>

<p>The first versions of the dashboard were distributed with PSP
scripts and forms bundled-in.  The dashboard development team was
originally under the impression that this was permitted, since the
copyright page of the PSP book contains the statement:

<blockquote class="ital">The tables in appendix C of this book or
electronic copies thereof may be copied, used, or modified by owners
of this book or users of the materials it contains.</blockquote>

The dashboard development team originally interpreted this statement
as written permission from the publisher to make electronic copies of
the scripts and forms in Appendix C of the book <u>A&nbsp;Discipline
for Software Engineering</u>, and incorporate those materials into the
dashboard download.  (Apparently, other development teams must have
made the same assumption, because several other PSP tools already in
existence in 1997 also included PSP scripts and forms.)</p>

<p>However, in February of 2002, Watts Humphrey (the author of the PSP
book) brought it to our attention that the statement in the book does
not grant permission to <u>distribute</u> electronic copies of the PSP
scripts and forms.  At that time, he instructed us to discontinue all
downloads of the Process Dashboard, and to instruct our users that
they were to desist in the usage of the program.</p>

<p>Mr. Humphrey worked with Addison-Wesley to arrange permission for
the PSP scripts and forms to once again be distributed for use with
the dashboard, but only under the condition that users consent to a
license agreement:</p>

<blockquote class="ital">Although I understand that I may use the
Personal Software Process<SUP>SM</SUP> (PSP<SUP>SM</SUP>) materials
provided with this Dashboard tool, I will not copy, modify, or
distribute these materials without first obtaining written permission
from Addison-Wesley. Furthermore, I will not represent myself as using
the PSP process unless I have been trained to do so by an
SEI-authorized PSP instructor.</blockquote>

<blockquote class="ital">The PSP was developed by Watts S. Humphrey
and is described in his book, <u>A Discipline for Software
Engineering</u>. The PSP provides a powerful way to develop software,
but it is effective only if properly used. While this tool aids
trained professionals in applying the PSP methods, it does not provide
instruction on how to use the PSP.</blockquote>

<blockquote class="ital">Personal Software Process and PSP are service
marks of Carnegie Mellon University.</blockquote>

<p>With this permission in place, we were once again able to offer the
dashboard for download, beginning in March of 2002.</p>

<p>Since that time, however, we have received complaints from many
users about this license agreement.  Several individuals have pointed
out that this additional license agreement conflicts with the terms of
the <a href="#doc16_top">GNU Public License</a> (under which the
dashboard is distributed).  Upon advice from the Free Software
Foundation, and after receiving a modified
<a href="#doc25_top">permission letter</a> from
Addison-Wesley, we have removed the PSP scripts and forms from the
Process Dashboard distribution, and moved them into a separately
downloaded file.  The main Process Dashboard distribution is once
again freely available under the terms of the GPL, and the PSP
materials are separately available under the terms of the license
agreement displayed above.</p>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>

<p>I am writing to you on behalf of the members of the Software
Process Dashboard Initiative. As ardent supporters of the Personal
Software Process<sup>(SM)</sup>, we have developed an open-source
support tool that automates many of the process activities described
in the book <i>A&nbsp;Discipline for Software Engineering</i>, written
by Watts Humphrey.  To enhance the support this tool provides to
engineers, we would like permission to include the following
copyrighted PSP<sup>(SM)</sup> materials in our tool:</p>

</table>

<p>These materials would be integrated into the tool so users could
receive process guidance and support at the click of a button.</p>

<p>We would distribute the resulting tool, free of charge, over the
Internet.  The tool would be distributed primarily via our website,
http://processdash.sourceforge.net/, as a free download.
Occasionally, we would also like to distribute the software on CDs for
the convenience of our users.</p>

<p>Because our tool has been explicitly developed in an open-source
model, it would be available to users free of charge. Our goal from
the beginning has been to promote the use of the Personal Software
Process; we feel that a zero-cost support tool would remove one of the
most common hurdles engineer face.  By encouraging the use of the PSP,
we feel that this tool would enhance sales of the book
<i>A&nbsp;Discipline for Software Engineering</i>.</p>

<p>We look forward to your response.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br></p>

<P>Planning a software project is just as important as planning any other 
complicated endeavor.  In his book <I>A Discipline for Software 
Engineering</I> Watts Humphrey devotes three chapters to planning 
activities.  This help topic will not rehash the ideas put forth there, but 
will simply serve as a reminder that planning is essential!</P>

<P>The Process Dashboard can provide some help in your planning activities.  
The <a href="#doc28_top">hierarchy editor</a> allows you to 
enter a work breakdown structure for your activities into the dashboard so 
that time, size, and defect data can be tracked, and the <a href="#doc31_top">PROBE tool</a> and <a href="#doc30_top">PROBE Wizard</a> help automate the <b>PRO</b>xy 
<b>B</b>ased <b>E</b>stimation method.  Finally, the <a href="#doc32_top">Task and Schedule Tool</a> allows you to
create a schedule and track your progress against it using earned value.</P>

</div>
<div>

</div>
<a name="doc27_top"></a><div>


<H2><a name="para_2_1_"></a>2.1. Entering process data</H2>
<P>There are two main ways of entering data into the Process Dashboard.  The 
first is through various input tools and dialogs provided by the dashboard 
(e.g. the <a href="#doc43_top">defect dialog</a>, the 
<A HREF="#doc42_top">time log editor</A>, etc.).</p>

<p>The second is through various process forms.  The scripts and forms are 
provided through an integrated web interface.  See the <a href="#doc39_top">Accessing Process Scripts</a> help 
topic for more info on how to access the scripts and forms.  To find out more 
information about the different process scripts and forms that are available, 
see the <a href="#doc2_top">process scripts</a> help 
topic.</p>


<h3><a name="para_2_1_1_"></a>2.1.1. The nature of the dashboard forms</h3>
<P>The dashboard forms are implemented via static and sometimes dynamic HTML 
pages. Unlike the HTML forms you see on the internet, the forms on these HTML 
pages are "live" at all times, much like a spreadsheet. You can type values 
in the input fields and other fields will recalculate automatically, even if 
those fields are in different browser windows. There is no need to press any 
kind of "submit data" button.</P>

<P>After typing in a value, you must generally "leave" that input field to 
signal that you are finished entering information. Pressing the "Tab" key (to 
move to the next input field) or clicking anywhere else on the page is 
generally sufficient. As soon as the "input cursor" leaves the field in 
question, the dashboard will automatically pick up your data, recalculate 
related data items, and save your data for future sessions.  The dashboard
will make a small &quot;clicking&quot; noise to let you know that it has
saved the data.  If you do not hear this noise, there may be a problem 
with your browser that is preventing the dashboard data integration from
working properly;  see the 
<a href="#doc50_BrokenForms">troubleshooting page</a>
for more information.</P>

<P>If you enter an invalid value for a data item (for example, typing "foo"
in an input field that is expecting a number), the dashboard will reject the 
invalid value and restore the previous value for that input field.</P>

<p>The dashboard uses various visual cues to show you where data is missing 
or where a calculated value could not be completed.  Here is a partial screen 
shot of a dashboard form that shows several of the ways the 
dashboard indicates incomplete or bad data.  NOTE: this screen shot is from 
the Internet Explorer browser.  Your browser may not be color coded in 
exactly the same way.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/ShowMissingFields.png"></center></p>

<a name="doc27_missing"><P></a>When a required data value is <I>missing</I>, the 
dashboard will display "<code>?????</code>". This is an indication that you 
still need to enter a value for that data item. Therefore, you should ensure 
that there are no "<code>?????</code>" symbols in the Plan column of your 
project plan summary before marking the Planning phase complete. Similarly, 
make certain you fill in all missing values in the Actual column of your 
project plan summary before marking the project complete.</P>

<P>If the dashboard cannot recalculate a formula because the formula 
references a missing ("<code>?????</code>") or otherwise invalid data value, 
it will display "<code>#VALUE!</code>" as the result of the calculation.  
When you see "<code>#VALUE!</code>" in a dashboard form, it almost 
<I>always</I> means that there is a "<code>?????</code>" field somewhere that 
you still need to fill in.</P>

<P>If the dashboard recalculates a formula and encounters a divide-by-zero 
error, it will display "<code>#DIV/0!</code>" as the result of the 
calculation. Divide-by-zero errors are common when you first begin using the 
dashboard, since you will not have any historical data.</P>

<P>To make all this possible, the dashboard software actually contains a very 
small HTTP server embedded within it.  This server allows communication 
between the HTML pages and the process data that is tracked by the 
dashboard.  If you close the dashboard program while one of the HTML forms is 
open, the form will reset and display "<code>NO CONNECTION</code>". You can

your browser to reload the HTML page.</P>

<H3><a name="para_2_1_2_"></a>2.1.2. Frozen Calculations</H3>

<P>If you edit the value in an input field, and related data items don't 
recalculate, the data is probably <I>frozen</I>. Remember that when you mark 
the planning phase of a PSP project complete, all the Planned data elements 
are baselined and stop recalculating.  Similarly, when you mark a PSP project 
complete, the Actual and To Date data elements will freeze and stop 
recalculating. So if you expect formulas to recalculate and they don't, check 
to make certain that the planning phase and the entire project are <U>not</U>
marked complete. For more information, see the <A HREF="#doc36_top">Data Freezing</A> help topic.</P>

<a name="doc27_unlock"></a><h3><a name="para_2_1_3_"></a>2.1.3. Read-only data fields</h3>

<P>The Process Dashboard automatically calculates many data elements for
you.  Normally, these calculated data values are not directly editable, but
rather they will update when other data elements to which they are related
get updated.  If you are using a recent web browser, these values are
displayed with a grey background.</p>

<P>Sometimes you may decide that you want to override one or more of these 
calculated values.  You can "unlock" these read-only data elements by 
clicking on the "<u>Unlock read-only data</u>" link at the bottom of the 
page.  Unlocking read-only data will make all the elements on the page 
editable, allowing you to override calculated values with your own.</p>

<P>Unlocking read-only data is useful for times when you intentionally want 
to override a calculation, but it is not without risk.  Once you have 
overridden a calculation, it will no longer automatically update in response 
to changes in related data items.  In addition, related calculations may no 
longer add up like you would normally expect.  Therefore, this feature should 
be used with caution.</p>

<p>After you have overridden a calculation with some value, you may decide 
that you want the old calculation back.  Just type <code>DEFAULT</code> in 
the input field, and when you leave the field the old calculation will be 
restored.</p>

<a name="doc27_exporting"></a><h3><a name="para_2_1_4_"></a>2.1.4. Exporting form data</h3>

<p>When you open a dashboard form, the form connects to the process dashboard
to retrieve the most up-to-date values for all the data elements on the page.
If you choose the &quot;File <img src="Images/rarrow.png"> Save&quot;
option from your browser, you will find that only the form is saved; the values
contained in the form are not.  If you want to save an electronic copy of a
dashboard form (for example, to email to a coworker, or to save with project
documentation), click the "Export to HTML" link at the bottom of the page.  The
dashboard will create an HTML version of the form containing a <i>snapshot</i>
of your data.  This HTML snapshot can be saved using the &quot;File <img src="Images/rarrow.png"> Save&quot; option of your browser.</p>

<p>If you would like to perform additional analysis on the data in a 
dashboard form, use the "Export to Excel" link at the bottom of the page. 
This will open the form in Excel, where you can reference the data in Excel 
charts and equations. For more information on the Excel export feature, see 
the <A HREF="#doc49_excel">Exporting your 
data</A> help topic.</p>

<p><b>Important:</b> the Excel version of the form contains <i>exported</i>
data only.  If you edit values in the Excel spreadsheet, your changes will 
not be imported back into the Process Dashboard. To change a data value in 
the Process Dashboard, you must make the change in a dashboard form.</p>

<H2><a name="para_2_2_"></a>2.2. <!--SEP--><a href="#doc23_top"><img border="0" class="sepnotice" src="Images/PSPDisclaimer.png"></a> <!--/SEP-->Using the hierarchy editor</h2>

<P>The hierarchy editor allows you to create a work breakdown structure for 
your work, and also defines the process elements that will be used for a 
given software project. The hierarchy editor can be opened by selecting the
"Hierarchy" option on the <a href="#doc45_top">configure
menu</a>.</P>

<P>Its basic function is to allow creation and deletion of nodes in a project 
tree.  You can create any arbitrary node structure to organize the different 
types of projects you are working on, and add project templates to the tree 
from the template files provided.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/HierarchyEditorStart.png"></center></p>

<P>When the hierarchy editor is started, it looks more or less like this.  In 
the screen shot shown, some child nodes have already been defined under both 
"Project" and "Non Project".</p>

<P>When the little tree control is pointing to the right, it indicates that 
the node can be expanded.  Clicking the tree control will cause the expansion 
of the tree.  When the control is pointing down, it indicates that the node 
is showing its expansion and can be collapsed.</p>

<h3><a name="para_2_2_1_"></a>2.2.1. The File menu</h3>

<P>The File menu provides the choices of Close, Save, and Revert.  Their 
functionality is pretty self-explanatory:  Close closes the editor, Save 
saves the changes to the dashboard project tree, and Revert will revert the 
project tree back to the state of the last save or to when the editor was 
opened.</p>

<h3><a name="para_2_2_2_"></a>2.2.2. The Edit menu and toolbar</h3>

<P>The Edit menu provides some rudimentary editing control on the project 
hierarchy.  It provides the choices of Delete, Move Up, Move Down, Cut, Paste, Add Node, and Add Template.  Several of these choices are duplicated on the
Edit toolbar.</P>

<P><B>Delete</B> will allow the deletion of a portion of the project tree.  
It deletes the selected node and all its children from the tree.  Be careful; 
deleted nodes and projects cannot be revived once you save your changes. 
Deleted projects will no longer contribute to your historical data. 
Therefore, you probably don't want to delete projects unless they contain no 
real data. If you find that many historical projects are cluttering up your 
hierarchy, your best strategy is to create a node in your hierarchy called 
&quot;Archived Projects,&quot; then use Cut and Paste to move completed 
projects there.</p>

<P><B>Move Up</B> and <B>Move Down</B> alter the relative position of the 
selected node in the tree. The selected node will still have the same parent, 
but it will appear earlier or later in the list of children for that parent. 
Since the <A HREF="#doc32_top">task and schedule</A> feature 
assumes that tasks will be performed in hierarchy order, Move Up and Move 
Down can help rearrange nodes so they appear in the order you plan to work on 
them.</p>

<P><B>Cut</B> and <B>Paste</B> can be used to move a node / project from one 
part of the tree to another. Simply highlight the node or project you wish to 
move, and choose Cut. Then highlight the new parent for the node or project, 
and choose Paste. The cut node (and all its children) will be relocated 
underneath the new parent. You can then use Move Up and Move Down to 
reposition the node relative to its siblings.</p>

<P><B>Add Node</B> allows insertion of nodes into the tree. Nodes created
in this way serve two general purposes:</p>

<OL>
  <LI>They behave like &quot;folders&quot;, which can contain other nodes
    and/or projects. This allows you to add organization to your work
    projects.</LI>
  <LI>They can be used to track time for process-less tasks like
    &quot;reading email.&quot; If your employer requires you to track your
    time for tasks like these, you can create an entire hierarchy of such
    nodes for time tracking purposes. These nodes will <B><U>not</U></B>
    interfere with your historical PSP project data - they will not
    contribute toward To Date calculations and they will not appear in PROBE 
   linear regressions.</LI>
</OL>

<P>Actual projects themselves should <em>NOT</em> be added in this way, but 
should be added via Add Template (see below).  The Add Node menu brings up a 
cascading second menu that provides the choices of Above, Below, and As 
Child.  Again, these are pretty self-explanatory: Above will add a node to 
the tree as a sibling to the selected node, and will place it above the 
selected node; Below will also add a sibling node, but will place it below 
the selected node; As Child will add a node as a child of the selected 
node.</p>

<P><B>Add Template</B> allows insertion of a process template into the tree.  
Use this choice when you are ready to define a project.  The Add Template 
menu brings up a cascading second menu that provides choices among the 
various defined processes.  By default, two simple templates are provided:
<a href="#doc2_generic">Generic</a> and
<a href="#doc2_timer">Timer</a>.  If you have
installed the PSP process definitions, you will also see the 7 PSP process
levels, along with <A HREF="#doc53_top">Rollup
PSP Data</A>.  If you have installed any other add-on process sets, other
choices will appear as well.  For more information about the processes and
their scripts, see the <a href="#doc2_top">process
scripts</A> help topic.</p>

<P>When you insert a project template into the hierarchy, it will initially 
have a generic name like &quot;PSP2.1&quot;. You should feel free to change 
its name immediately to something more descriptive. (To make dashboard 
operation clear, this help document often displays projects with names like 
&quot;PSP0&quot;, but such bland project names are neither required nor 
expected for actual use.)</p>

<P>Any node in the project hierarchy can be renamed except for the process
elements themselves (i.e. Planning, Design, Code, etc.).  To rename a node,
click the node once to select it, then wait a moment and click it again to go
into edit mode.  The name will appear as a text entry.  You can hit return to
finish changing the name, or escape to cancel the name change. 
<b>Important:</b> Node names cannot contain the '/' character.</p>

<h3><a name="para_2_2_3_"></a>2.2.3. Process templates</h3>

<P>When a process template is added, all the process phase elements that are 
defined for that process will be automatically added as children.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/HierarchyEditorShowAddedPSP0.png"></center></p>

<P>These process phases cannot be edited in any way (with a couple 
exceptions).  If a process phase is selected and the Edit menu is clicked, 
the menu will show all entries greyed out and disabled.  This is to protect 
the integrity of the processes themselves.</p>

<h3><a name="para_2_2_4_"></a>2.2.4. Processes PSP0 - PSP1.1</h3>
<P>PSP processes PSP0 through PSP1.1 do not provide for design or code 
reviews, as those improvements are introduced in PSP level 2.  However, the 
dashboard will allow you to add design and or code reviews to these low level 
PSP processes if you choose.  If you pick on a project that was defined from 
the PSP0, PSP0.1, PSP1, or PSP1.1 process templates and then choose the "Add
Template" menu you will see Design Review and Code Review choices.  Either of
these can be added to the process.  They will be automatically inserted in the
correct places in the process phase order.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/HierarchyEditorShowPSP0Reviews.png"></center></p>

<p>Once you insert a Design Review or Code Review phase, it will appear in
the process scripts and forms for the project. If you later change your mind 
and decide you don't want the review phase after all, you can highlight it 
and choose Delete from the Edit menu.</p>

<a name="doc28_cyclic"></a><h3><a name="para_2_2_5_"></a>2.2.5. The PSP3 process</h3>
<P>The PSP3 process is a cyclic development process.  As such, it provides a 
basic structure for the whole project and also provides the ability to add 
development cycles.  When a PSP3 process is added to the hierarchy, it will 
have the basic skeletal structure defined (Planning, High Level Design, High 
Level Design Review, and Postmortem phases), along with one PSP3 cycle.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/HierarchyEditorShowEmptyPSP3.png"></center></p>

<P>Once you decide upon your cyclical development strategy, you should create 
additional cycles underneath the PSP3 project. Each of these cycles will 
contain the other PSP3 process phases (Design, Design Review, Code, Code 
Review, Compile, Test, and Reassessment).  The PSP3 cycles are added just 
like the PSP3 project itself, via the "Add Template" menu.  When a PSP3 based 
project is selected and the Edit menu is chosen, the Add Template menu item 
will have only one available choice: PSP3cycle.  The cycle will be placed 
appropriately before the Postmortem step.  You can input as many cycles as 
you would like in this manner.</p>

<H2><a name="para_2_3_"></a>2.3. <!--SEP--><a href="#doc23_top"><img border="0" class="sepnotice" src="Images/PSPDisclaimer.png"></a> <!--/SEP-->Using the Size Estimating Template</H2>

<P>The Size Estimating Template is used to help make estimates of how big a 
new software project will be or how long it will take to create the project 
(size and time estimation).  It is patterned after the Size Estimating 
Template from Watts Humphrey's book <i>A Discipline for Sofware 
Engineering</i> (table C39).  The online version of this form takes advantage 
of dynamic HTML to make the form easier to use.</p>

<P class="ifpsp">Here is the form as it appears for PSP1.1 and later
processes (PSP1 lacks the time estimation section and only estimates
program size)</p>

<p class="ifpsp" align="center"><img src="Images/SizeEstimatingTemplate.png"></p>

<P>Right near the top of the form is a link to bring up the Size Estimating 
Template instructions form (table C40).  The dashboard will bring up the 
instructions in a separate web browser so that the two can be placed side by 
side on your screen.</p>

<P>Also, there are several links on the form that will add rows to the form.  
If you need more room than the form provides, just click on the appropriate 
link and it will expand for you (so much better than paper!)</p>

<P>The header section contains entries for the name of the project and your 
name.  Both of these fields should be automatically filled in by the 
dashboard (if your name does not appear, go ahead and enter it -- it will 
show up on the other forms as well).</p>

<a name="doc29_baseLOC"></a><h3><a name="para_2_3_1_"></a>2.3.1. Base Program LOC</h3>

<P>The Base Program LOC section is where you enter the information about any 
base LOC that are going to go into your project.  The form has blanks for 
both ESTIMATED and ACTUAL sets of data.  When using this form for planning 
purposes, the ESTIMATED columns should get filled in.  After the project is 
finished and you are in the postmortem phase, you should enter data in the 
ACTUAL columns.</p>

<P>The form asks for the base LOC size, the number of deleted LOC, and the 
number of modified LOC.  In the base LOC entry, enter the number of LOC that 
will be used for the project that already exist at the time the project 
starts.  For example if you are creating a modification to an already 
existing program, the LOC from the existing program count as base LOC.</P>

<P>The form also asks for the number of deleted and the number of modified 
LOC.  These are LOC that were part of the base program that are either 
deleted or changed during the software project.</P>

<a name="doc29_objectLOC"></a><h3><a name="para_2_3_2_"></a>2.3.2. Object LOC</h3>
<P>The PSP tends to refer to all programming modules as objects.  If you are 
programming in an object oriented language such as C++, Java, or Smalltalk, 
then it makes sense to think in terms of real O-O objects.  If however you 
are programming in a non-object oriented language such as C, FORTRAN, or even 
BASIC, then it makes more sense to think in logical groupings of functionality 
such as functions or subroutines or procedures.</p>

<a name="doc29_baseAdditions"></a><h4><a name="para_2_3_2_1_"></a>2.3.2.1. Base Additions</h4>

<P>Base Additions LOC are lines added to objects/modules that already exist 
in the base program.  The form gives blanks for a description of the added 
code, the type of functionality that is being added, the number of methods 
that are going to be added of this type, the relative size of these methods, 
and estimates/measures of the LOC that are being added.</p>

<P>The type field is one of Calculation, Data, I/O, Logic, Setup or Text.  
Whichever of these categories best fits the type of new code that is being 
added should be chosen from the drop down.</p>

<P>The number of methods really only applies to object oriented and/or object 
based languages.  If you are not programming in such a language, you can 
simply put 1 in this entry to indicate that you are creating functions or 
subroutines.</p>

<P>The relative size pull down allows you to choose from subjective size 
categories such as Very Small, Small, Medium, Large, and Very Large.  The 
division between categories will vary by programming language and by your 
experience.  The categorization of relative size is only to help you in your 
estimates.  Watts Humphrey explains how to determine the cutoff for the 
various size categories in <i>A Discipline for Software Engineering</i>.

<P>In the estimated and actual LOC blanks you are to enter LOC amounts.  The 
table that Watts Humphrey provided for relating relative sizes to C++ LOC is 
available from the link marked "EST. LOC".  Again, only your data can direct 
how many LOC belong in each category.</p>

<P>The totals will update automatically as you enter your data.</p>

<a name="doc29_newObjects"></a><h4><a name="para_2_3_2_2_"></a>2.3.2.2. New Objects</h4>
<P>New Objects are probably where the bulk of new development will happen in 
most of your projects.  The entries are identical to those discussed in the 
Base Additions section with one exception.  Beside the estimated and actual 
LOC columns are columns of little checkboxes.  Put a check in these boxes if 
the new object on the corresponding line is considered a "New Reused" LOC.  
"New Reused" code is code that is sufficiently general purpose that it can be 
checked into a reuse library.  Generally this means more than just code that 
can probably be reused in the general sense.  It usually has to do with 
proper packaging of the code as well: Are proper interfaces defined?  Is the 
code sufficiently well documented?  Etc.</p>

<a name="doc29_reusedObjects"></a><h4><a name="para_2_3_2_3_"></a>2.3.2.3. Reused Objects</h4>
<P>Reused Objects are objects that are brought into the program from a reuse 
library.  The line between a reused object LOC and a base LOC can sometimes 
get blurry.  The main rule is that you must not count the same LOC as both 
base and reused.  The LOC counting formulas will not work out correctly in 
that case.</p> <!-- more to say here?  Or leave well enough alone? -->

<a name="doc29_time"></a><h3><a name="para_2_3_3_"></a>2.3.3. Performing the size/time estimation</h3>
<P>Once you have thought through all the changes that are going to be made to 
the software, you are ready to calculate a prediction of size and or time.  
The form will add up the Estimated Object LOC for you.  This is the
number that you will use as your base estimate in the PROBE method.</p>

<p class="ifpsp" align="center"><img src="Images/ProbeWizardLink.png"></p>

<P>The Size Estimation Template offers a link that will allow you to choose 
the PROBE Wizard to help you make your estimates.  If you use the PROBE 
Wizard, it will read your Estimated Object LOC off the size estimating 
template automatically, and will save your chosen estimates back to the size 
estimating template automatically. For more information about using the PROBE 
Wizard, see the <a href="#doc30_top">Using the PROBE Wizard</a>
help topic.</p>

<P>On the other hand, if you use the PROBE tool, you will need to type the 
Estimated Object LOC into the Estimate field on the tool. Once you have 
investigated the relationships among your process data, you should manually 
copy your final estimates back to the size estimating template, along with 
the various other measures that come about as a result of the estimation 
(<i>B</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>B</i><sub>1</sub>, UPI, LPI, prediction range, 
r<sup>2</sup>, probe method selected). If you use PROBE method C or D, the 
Prediction Range field and the other numeric fields below it can be left 
blank. For more information about the PROBE tool provided by the dashboard, 
see the <a href="#doc31_top">Using the PROBE tool</a> help topic.</p>

<h3><a name="para_2_3_4_"></a>2.3.4. Entering Actual data during Postmortem</h3>

<P>Once you reach the Postmortem phase and you have the Actual data for LOC, 
you should return to this form to enter the actuals for the various measures 
on the form (base, deleted, modified, and total LOC, LOC counts for the 
various objects, etc.).</p>

<p class="ifpsp" align="center"><img src="Images/QSEnterActualLOC.png"></p>

<P>That's all the data that has to be entered on this form.  The dashboard 
calculates as much of the data for you as possible.  The numbers entered and 
calculated on this form will automatically appear on the Project Plan Summary 
form.</p>

<H2><a name="para_2_4_"></a>2.4. <!--SEP--><a href="#doc23_top"><img border="0" class="sepnotice" src="Images/PSPDisclaimer.png"></a> <!--/SEP-->Using the PROBE Wizard</H2>

<P>The PROBE Wizard provides assistance in making estimates by guiding you 
through the common PROBE scenarios that are required in the various PSP 
scripts.  The PROBE Wizard can be opened by clicking on the link found on the 
<a href="#doc29_top">Size Estimating Template</a>.</p>

<p>When the PROBE Wizard is activated, it starts with a welcoming screen that 
reminds you of the nature of estimating with the PROBE method.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/QSProbeWizardStartup.png"></center></p>

<h3><a name="para_2_4_1_"></a>2.4.1. PROBE Wizard Step 1</h3>
<p>Step 1 in the PROBE method is to verify that the Estimated Object 
LOC number is accurate.  The Wizard shows you the number you have input on 
the Size Estimating Template and asks you to verify that this is indeed a 
good estimate.</p>

<h3><a name="para_2_4_2_"></a>2.4.2. PROBE Wizard Step 2</h3>
<p>Step 2 is to verify your historical data.  The PROBE Wizard puts up a 
table of numbers that shows your estimations from previous PSP projects.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/ProbeWizard2.png"></center></p>

<p>On this pane, you can exclude data points that you know to be "outliers"
statistically.  By clicking on the checkboxes at the end of each row, you can 
exclude any data point that you know does not represent your normal work 
processes.  If you are not completely sure about the consequences of 
excluding outlier data, you should probably leave all of the boxes 
unchecked.</p>

<h3><a name="para_2_4_3_"></a>2.4.3. PROBE Wizard Step 3</h3>
<p>Step 3 is to estimate the size of the new development effort.  The PROBE 
method (as implemented by the Process Dashboard) outlines 5 ways to estimate 
size:</p>

<p><table border=0 cellpadding=2 hspace=5>

 <tr valign="top"><td>A</td>
  <td>Estimate size based on a good correlation between previous Estimated 
   Object LOC data and Actual New and Changed LOC data. This method is the 
   most preferred method, but can only be used if you have sufficient data 
   that correlates well.</td>
 </tr>

 <tr valign="top"><td>B</td>
  <td>If Object LOC estimates do not correlate well enough to use method A, 
   PROBE suggests estimating size based on a good correlation between 
   previous Estimated New and Changed LOC data and Actual New and Changed LOC 
   data. Again, this method can only be used if you have sufficient data that 
   correlates well.</td>
 </tr>

 <tr valign="top"><td>C1</td>
  <td>If neither of the data pairings for methods A and B correlate, but you 
   do have Estimated Object LOC data, you can use that data to do the 
   estimate.  This method requires at least some Estimated Object LOC data be 
   recorded.</td>
 </tr>

 <tr valign="top"><td>C2</td>
  <td>If you do not have any Estimated Object LOC, but you do have Estimated 
   New and Changed LOC data, you can use that data to do the estimate.  This 
   method requires at least some Estimated New and Changed LOC data be 
   recorded.</td>

 <tr valign="top"><td>D</td>
  <td>If you have no historical data, method D just indicates that you should 
   use your best engineering judgement to make the estimate.</td></tr>
</table></p>

<p>The Wizard will present all of these possibilities to you in decreasing 
order of preference based on how well each method seems to track (or 
correlates) with your historical data.  You just have to choose the method 
you would like to follow by picking from a set of radio boxes.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/ProbeWizard3.png"></center></p>

<p>The Wizard also has links to explanatory help windows that will pop up and 
give you more detail about the different types of calculations that it is 
doing to generate the different estimates.  These links are shown in <font color="blue">blue text</font>.</p>

<h3><a name="para_2_4_4_"></a>2.4.4. PROBE Wizard Step 4</h3>
<p>Step 4 is very similar to step 3, except the estimation is for time 
instead of size.  The same basic set of methods is available, and the Wizard 
will offer each data estimate in decreasing order of preference.</p>

<p>The PROBE method (as implemented by the Process Dashboard) outlines 6 ways 
to estimate time:</p>

<p><table border=0 cellpadding=2 hspace=5>

 <tr valign="top"><td>A</td>
  <td>Estimate time based on a good correlation between previous Estimated 
   Object LOC data and Actual time data. This method is the most preferred 
   method, but can only be used if you have sufficient data that correlates 
   well.</td>
 </tr>

 <tr valign="top"><td>B</td>
  <td>If Object LOC estimates do not correlate well enough to use method A, 
   PROBE suggests estimating time based on a good correlation between 
   previous Estimated New and Changed LOC data and Actual time data. Again, 
   this method can only be used if you have sufficient data that correlates 
   well.</td>
 </tr>

 <tr valign="top"><td>C1</td>
  <td>If neither of the data pairings for methods A and B correlate, but you 
   do have Estimated Object LOC data, you can use that data to do the 
   estimate.  This method requires at least some Estimated Object LOC data be 
   recorded.</td>
 </tr>

 <tr valign="top"><td>C2</td>
  <td>If you do not have any Estimated Object LOC, but you do have Estimated 
   New and Changed LOC data, you can use that data to do the estimate.  This 
   method requires at least some Estimated New and Changed LOC data be 
   recorded.</td>

 <tr valign="top"><td>C3</td>
  <td>If you only have Actual Time and Size data, you can use that data to do 
   the estimate.</td>

 <tr valign="top"><td>D</td>
  <td>If you have no historical data, method D just indicates that you should 
   use your best engineering judgement to make the estimate.</td></tr>
</table></p>

<p>Unlike other wizards you may have used in the past, the PROBE Wizard 
updates the data in the dashboard whenever you click the Continue button to 
move onward (that is why there is no Cancel button on the Wizard).  If you 
make a mistake while using the Wizard, you'll have to use the Back button to 
go back and fix it, or make the change manually on the Size Estimating 
Template.  Of course, you can always just run the PROBE Wizard a second 
time.</p>

<h3><a name="para_2_4_5_"></a>2.4.5. PROBE Wizard Step 5</h3>

<p>At this point, you are finished making your estimates.  Step 5 encourages 
you to check the estimates to make sure that they make sense.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/ProbeWizard5.png"></center></p>

<p>Clicking Finish dismisses the PROBE Wizard.</p>

<h3><a name="para_2_4_6_"></a>2.4.6. A sanity check</h3>

<p>After you use various PROBE methods to independently generate your size 
estimate and your time estimate, it is always a good idea to "sanity check"
those estimates to ensure that they are reasonable and in synch with each 
other.  The final screen of the PROBE Wizard helps with this task.  It uses 
your size and time estimates to calculate your planned productivity, and then 
compares this number with your historical productivity to date.  When your 
planned productivity is significantly different than your historical 
productivity, it is usually a warning flag indicating that either your size 
estimate or your time estimate (or possibly both) is incorrect.  When this 
occurs, the PROBE wizard strongly encourages you to reexamine your 
estimates.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/ProbeWizardPoorEstimate.png"></center></p>

<p>If you rexamine your estimates and decide not to change them, you can 
simply close the PROBE Wizard (using the "X" in the window title bar). The 
estimates you chose for size and time will still appear on the Size 
Estimating Template.</p>

<H2><a name="para_2_5_"></a>2.5. Using the PROBE tool</H2>

<P>The PROBE tool provides assistance in making estimates by performing the 
PROBE calculations for you. The PROBE tool can be opened by selecting the
"PROBE" option on the <a href="#doc45_top">configure
menu</a>.</p>

<p>This version of the Process Dashboard also contains a PROBE Wizard that 
can help step you through the PROBE estimation process.  You can find out 
more about the PROBE Wizard by reading the <a href="#doc30_top">Using the PROBE Wizard</a> help topic.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/ProbeToolStart.png"></center></p>

<p>The PROBE tool is much more powerful than the PROBE Wizard. It can perform 
correlation tests and projections based on any two process data metrics.  The 
Method pull-down allows quick access to the different estimation methods 
provided by the PROBE estimation method.  Clicking on the pull-down gives the 
following choices:</p>

<P><center><img src="Images/ProbeToolMethods.png"></center></p>

<P>Choosing any of the standard PROBE methods (as defined in the book 
<a href="Topics/Overview/disc-eng.html">A&nbsp;Discipline for Software
Engineering</a> will set the independent and dependent variables to
their appropriate values.</p>

<P>If you would like to explore correlations between any two other process 
metric variables, they can be chosen from the independent and dependent 
variable pull-downs.</p>

<P><a name="doc31_average"></a><a name="doc31_regression"></a>Basically the PROBE 
tool runs a correlation test on the two sets of data chosen.  It then reports 
the various statistical measurements on the dialog.  There are two types of 
measurements shown on the dialog: those that show relationships between the 
sets of data chosen (r<sup>2</sup>, p, Variance, Standard Deviation), and 
those that are related to a projection based on the estimate entered 
(<i>B</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>B</i><sub>1</sub>, Range, UPI and LPI).  Also there 
are two columns of data on the tool.  The left column shows data based on a 
linear regression (this is for methods A and B the PROBE estimation method) 
and the right column shows data based on how well your data seem to predict 
on the average (this is for the different C methods of the PROBE estimation 
method).</p>

<a name="doc31_probeDialogFilter"></a><h3><a name="para_2_5_1_"></a>2.5.1. Filtering your data set</h3>
<P>The filter button allows you to restrict the data set of the correlation 
and projection to certain projects.  It will pop up a tree view of the 
current projects stored and allow you to add or remove data items from the 
selected set.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/ProbeFilter.png"></center></p>

<p>Seleted items are marked with a graphical "X".  By default the tool only 
shows projects in the tree (nodes).  You can expand this view to include the 
process phases as well by choosing the "Show leaf nodes" box.  This will 
allow you to include or reject data from among different phases of projects.  
The Apply button applies your filtering selection to the numbers in the PROBE 
dialog.</p>

<h3><a name="para_2_5_2_"></a>2.5.2. Measures of correlation</h3>
<P>On a typical estimation, you will want to choose from the different 
combinations of correlations available to see if any of the data correlate 
well enough to be used for projections.  The PROBE tool will make this quite 
simple.  Just pick the two data sets you would like to correlate, and the 
numbers on the tool will update to show you the results. The key numbers to 
examine are the measure of correlation (r<sup>2</sup>) and the significance 
measurement (p).</p>

<a name="doc31_correlation"></a><h4><a name="para_2_5_2_1_"></a>2.5.2.1. The correlation measurement</h4>
<p>As detailed by Watts Humphrey, an r<sup>2</sup> value of over 0.5 
indicates that the numbers correlate well enough to use a linear regression 
method.  The degree of confidence as measured by the r<sup>2</sup> variable 
is shown on the dialog by its color.  When the value is too low to be used 
for predictive purposes, the r<sup>2</sup> value will show up in red.  Values 
that show better and better agreement are shown in different colors.  The 
colors used are: red (very bad), yellow/orange (fair), blue (good), and black 
(very good).</p>

<a name="doc31_significance"></a><h4><a name="para_2_5_2_2_"></a>2.5.2.2. The significance measurement</h4>
<p>The significance measurement is an indication of how significant the 
correlation is.  It is expressed in a percentage that represents the 
probability that this correlation could have happened by chance.  Low numbers 
mean that the data is probably showing a causality and can be used to make 
projections.  The same color scheme to show the relative "goodness" of the 
data is used here.</p>

<P>Both measures need to be taken into consideration before using a 
projection from a linear correlation.  There are some data combinations that 
can make one of the measurements look good while the other is bad.  For 
example if you have data that correlate well but the significance of that 
correlation is not very high, you could be looking at a random occurrence.</p>

<a name="doc31_interval"></a><a name="doc31_projection"></a><h3><a name="para_2_5_3_"></a>2.5.3. Making a projection</h3>
<P>To make a projection, just enter an estimate in the Estimate entry.  The 
estimate should be an estimate of the type of data that is chosen in the top 
pull down box marked "Correlate".  For example, you should put an estimated 
number of New &amp; Changed LOC in the entry if you are correlating against 
Estimated New &amp; Changed LOC.  The % range entry will allow you to change 
the confidence interval of the projection.  Most PSP work is done at a 70% 
confidence interval, but you can set this as high or as low as you would 
like.  Setting the confidence interval higher will give you a wider range of 
possible values, and setting the interval lower will narrow the range of 
possible values.</p>

<P>As you change the input parameters, the tool will relcalculate all the
numbers appropriately.  Some calculations may display ERROR if the data is
poorly correlated, or if there are not enough historical data points to
perform the calculation.
The projected estimate will show up at the top of both columns (the left 
column showing the projection using linear regression and the right column 
showing the projection based on an averaging technique).  It is up to you to 
decide which numbers are appropriate for making the projection.</p>

<a name="doc31_probeDialogChart"></a><h3><a name="para_2_5_4_"></a>2.5.4. Visualizing the data</h3>
<P>The PROBE tool also offers a scatterplot of your process data.  This view 
is chosen by clicking on the "Chart" button.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/ProbeChart.png"></center></p>

<P>The plot will show a scatterplot of the data being used for the regression 
calculations and two lines passing through the data.  A blue line shows the 
line as projected from <i>B</i><sub>0</sub> and <i>B</i><sub>1</sub>
calculated using linear regression, and a red line shows the line as 
projected from the averaging calculation.  Only one of these lines will be in 
color if you've chosen one of the standard PROBE estimating methods.  In this 
case, the other line is shown in grey.  If you choose a custom estimation 
method (i.e. you are comparing different sets of data than what the PROBE 
method calls for) both lines will show in color.  Many times this visual 
representation of the data can provide insights that straight numbers may 
not.</p>

<P>The three columns below the plot display the actual values used for the 
data plotted.  The first column contains the project name, and the second and 
third columns show the data values for the X and Y axes respectively.</p>

<H2><a name="para_2_6_"></a>2.6. Using the Task &amp; Schedule Tool</H2>

<P>The task and schedule tool allows you to generate a schedule for 
completing tasks, and track progress against that schedule using earned 
value. You can open the task and schedule tool by selecting the 
&quot;Task &amp; Schedule&quot; option on the
<a href="#doc45_top">configure menu</a>.</P>

<p>For more guidance in creating an earned value schedule, see the
<a href="#doc33_top">Creating a schedule step by step</a>
help topic.</p>

<P>If you haven't created any schedules, the dashboard will immediately
jump to the Create New Schedule dialog which will allow you to create one. 
If you have already created at least one schedule, a Task &amp; Schedule
chooser window will appear.</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/TaskScheduleChooser.png"></center></p>

<p>This window displays all the schedules you have created. After you click
on a schedule to highlight it, you can use the buttons along the bottom to
open it, rename it, or delete it. The Cancel button will close this window.</p>

<p>Clicking the New button will create a new schedule. The dashboard will ask 
you to enter a name for the new schedule.  This allows you to track different 
schedules from within the dashboard. When a new schedule is first created, an 
empty Task &amp; Schedule window will appear prompting you for the first task 
you want to add to the schedule.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/AddTaskToSchedule.png"></center></p>

<p>All the tasks that are to be tracked within the schedule must come from 
the project hierarchy defined using the 
<a href="#doc28_top">Hierarchy Editor</a>.  You can track 
progress against PSP projects, projects you have made using custom process 
scripts or add-on process sets, or even against just a hierarchy of task 
names that are not associated with a particular process in the dashboard.  
The Task &amp; Schedule tool is completely process independent.</p>

<P>The Task &amp; Schedule window combines a project task list and a
simple project schedule into one window.  The top portion of the
window gives a view of the task schedule on a task by task basis and
tracks metrics about each task.  The bottom portion of the window is
concerned with actual calendar time.  The time for the schedule is
broken out into time periods (e.g. weeks) and the columns track
metrics about each time period.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/TaskSchedule.png"></center></p>

<p>Editable values appear with a yellow background. If you are unfamiliar 
with the various columns in the task and schedule planning templates, you can 
hover the pointer over the column headings and a tool tip will tell you what 
the abbreviated heading stands for.</p>

<h3><a name="para_2_6_1_"></a>2.6.1. Columns in the Task List</h3>

<P>While this help topic won't get into all the details of earned value 
tracking, briefly here are the items that are shown in the upper window:</p>

<p><b>Planned Time (PT):</b> This is the amount of time you have
planned for the given task.  Generally this will be displayed in hours
and minutes.  However, if this field is editable, you can enter a
percentage instead of a duration to mark this task as a 
&quot;<a href="#doc33_loe">level of effort</a>&quot;
task.</p>

<p><b>Time</b> This is the actual amount of time spent on a given task.</p>

<p><b>Planned Value (PV):</b> This is the amount of earned value that will be 
earned by the given task based on the planned numbers.</p>

<p><b>Plan Date:</b> This is the date that the Task &amp; Schedule tool thinks 
you will finish the given task.  This number uses the data from the lower 
half of the Task &amp; Schedule tool to determine an ending date.</p>

<p><b>Date:</b> This is the actual completion date.  It will be filled in 
automatically when you mark the task complete via the <a href="#doc41_top">Completion Button</a>.</p>

<p><b>Percent Complete (%C):</b> This is the percent complete for the
current task.  Many people are accustomed to informally estimating
percent complete; PSP formalizes this concept:<ul>

  <li>If a task has no subtasks, it will either be 0% complete or 100%
      complete, based upon whether you have marked it complete via the
      <a href="#doc41_top">Completion Button</a>.</li>

  <li>If a task has subtasks, its percent complete is calculated by
      using the planned times of those tasks to compute a weighted
      average.</li>

</ul>At times you might wish for the ability to edit the "percent
complete" for a task because it is "90% done."  Unfortunately, this
often leads to tasks that reach 90% complete and stay there for weeks,
slipping the schedule.  PSP states that instead, you should break the
task down into subtasks and mark some of those subtasks complete.
That way, you will get an accurate measure of percent complete.</p>

<p><b>Percent Spent (%S):</b> This number describes the relationship
between planned time and actual time for the given task.  If you have
spent twice as much time on this task as you planned to spend, it
would be 200% spent.  If you have only used up half of the planned
time, the task would be 50% spent.</p>

<p><b>Earned Value (EV):</b> This is the actual amount of earned value that 
this task has earned.  <i>Remember that earned value measures are not counted 
until the task is marked as complete.</i></p>


<table border cellpadding="10px"><tr><td>

<b>Note:</b> The columns listed above are sufficient for most
simple planning.  As a result, the task list will usually only display
the columns listed above.  For advanced planning, however, some
additional information must also be displayed.  Therefore, the
following columns will automatically appear if: <ul>
<li>You manually prune subtasks out of your hierarchical task list
<li>You logged time to any of the tasks in your task list before
    the starting date of your schedule
<li>You completed any of the tasks in your task list before the
    starting date of your schedule
</ul></p>

<p><b>Planned Direct Time (PDT):</b> The &quot;Planned Time&quot;
column (described above) displays the <u>total</u> amount of time you
plan to spend on a task, no matter when that time gets spent.  In
contrast, the &quot;Planned Direct Time&quot; column displays the
amount of effort you plan to spend as part of <u>this schedule</u>.</p>

<p>An example can help illustrate the difference.  Imagine that one of
the tasks on your task list is to write a large software module. It
might have subtasks for requirements, design, implementation, and
formal testing.  The total amount of time needed to complete all of
these subtasks would be displayed in the &quot;Planned Time&quot;
column.  Now suppose you already completed requirements and design,
and started on the implementation, as part of an earlier project
iteration.  Furthermore, you don't plan to begin formal testing until
the next project iteration.  The &quot;Planned Direct Time&quot; for
requirements, design, and formal testing would be zero, since you
don't intend to spend any time on them during the current project
phase.  Also, since you already performed some of the work for the
implementation task, only the remaining portion of its planned time
would appear in the &quot;Planned Direct Time&quot; column.</p>

<p>The &quot;Planned Direct Time&quot; column will only be displayed
if it differs from the &quot;Planned Time&quot; column for at least
one task in your task list.  When it appears, you will note that the
&quot;plan value&quot; for a task is based on its planned direct time,
not its planned time.</p>

<p><b>Actual Direct Time (DTime):</b> The &quot;Actual Time&quot;
column displays the <u>total</u> amount of time you have spend on a
task to date, no matter when that time was spent.  In contrast, the
&quot;Actual Direct Time&quot; column displays the amount of effort
you have spent as part of <u>this schedule</u>.</p>

</td></tr></table>


<h3><a name="para_2_6_2_"></a>2.6.2. Columns in the Schedule List</h3>

<p>Briefly, here are the items that are shown in the bottom window:</p>

<p><b>From:</b> This is the starting date for a portion of your work 
schedule.  The schedule can start anytime and can be of just about any length 
(one week in duration, one day, one month, etc.).</p>

<p><b>To:</b> This is the ending date for a portion of your work
schedule.  Using the From and To fields, you can break your schedule
up into managable time chunks.  The Task &amp; Schedule tool defaults
to using time periods of one week in length, but you can edit the To
field to create time periods of any length (e.g. months, days, or even
hours).</p>

<p><b>Planned Time (PT):</b> This is the amount of time that will be 
applied to the tasks in the task list during the calendar time period 
selected by the From and To fields.  It defaults to 20 hours, but can be set 
to whatever number you think is accurate for the amount of time you will 
actually spend on task <i>during the given time period</i>.  Note that this 
is the total amount of time you plan on spending on <i>ALL</i> of the tasks 
listed in the top window.  The default numbers on the Task &amp; Schedule 
tool work out to 20 hours per week of work on task.</p>

<p><b>Cumulative Planned Direct Time (CPT):</b> This is the Planned Direct 
Time of the given time period, plus the times of all previous periods.</p>

<p><b>Cumulative Planned Value (CPV):</b> This shows cumulatively the amount 
of earned value that is planned for the given time period.</p>

<p><b>Actual Time (Time):</b> This shows the actual amount of time
spent on the tasks in the schedule during the given time period.</p>

<p><b>Cumulative Actual Direct Time (CT):</b> This shows the actual amount of 
direct time spent on task during the given time period cumulatively.</p>

<p><b>Actual Cumulative Earned Value (EV):</b> This shows the amount of earned 
value actually earned during the given time period cumulatively.</p>

<table border cellpadding="10px"><tr><td>

<b>Note:</b> The columns listed above are sufficient for most
simple planning.  As a result, the schedule list will usually only
display the columns listed above.  However, if your task list contains
any &quot;level of effort&quot; tasks, then &quot;time&quot; and
&quot;direct time&quot; will no longer be the same.  As a result, the
following columns will automatically appear:</p>

<p><b>Planned Direct Time (PDT):</b> The first column, labeled
&quot;PT,&quot; will display the total amount of time you plan to
spend during this period on <i>ALL</i> tasks in the task list; this
column, however, will show how much time is available after
subtracting time for &quot;level of effort&quot; tasks.</p>

<p><b>Percent Indirect Time (%I):</b> This shows the percentage of your
total actual time that you spent on &quot;level of effort&quot; tasks.</p>

<p><b>Actual Direct Time (DTime):</b> The &quot;Time&quot; column will
display the total amount of time you actually spent on <i>ALL</i>
tasks in the task list.  This column, however, will subtract out time
spent on &quot;level of effort&quot; tasks to show how much time you
spent on tasks that earn value.</p>

<H3><a name="para_2_6_5_"></a>2.6.5. Potential mistakes</H3>

<P>Be careful to avoid making the following mistakes when creating a 
schedule:</P>

<P><B>Duplicate tasks:</B> Nothing currently prevents you from adding the 
same task to your task list more than once. This could easily happen, for 
example, if you add a task to your task list, then add its parent as well.  
If you do this, the dashboard will dutifully create a schedule as if you were 
performing the task twice.</P>

<P><B>Conflicts between different schedules:</B> The dashboard lets you 
create multiple, independent schedules. It does not, however, offer any 
support for time management when multiple schedules are running concurrently. 
Nothing prevents you from creating twelve different concurrent schedules, and 
promising to spend 40 hours per week on each.  Also, nothing prevents you 
from adding one task to multiple different schedules.</P>

<P><B>Time estimates that don't add up:</B> The Planned Time (PT) column 
should always add up in a hierarchical manner; that is, the planned time for 
a parent node should always be equal to the sum of the planned times for all 
its children. This is almost always the case for the PSP processes that come 
with the dashboard. However, if you have
<A HREF="#doc27_unlock">unlocked</A> your data and overwritten 
calculations, times may no longer sum up correctly.  This problem can also
occur if you are using plain hierarchy "nodes" to describe tasks, and you
subdivide a node after estimating its time.  When this occurs, the 
task list will use the children's plan time for calculations rather than the 
parent's.  To correct this error, do one of the following:<ul>
<li>Edit the planned times for the children, so they agree with the planned
    time for the parent.
<li>Edit the planned time for the parent, so it agrees with the planned
    time for the children.
<li>Highlight the planned time for the parent, and delete it.
</ul></P>

<P><B>Missing time estimates:</b> Earned value forecasts and calculations
make heavy use of the the planned times for the tasks in your task list.
If you forget to estimate the planned time for a task in your task list,
these forecasts will be underestimated.</p>

<P>The dashboard automatically checks for <i>some</i> of these errors,
and displays an warning if they are found. If errors are present, they
will be highlighted with red text. If you hover the mouse over the red
text, a tool tip will provide a short description of the problem. For
a more complete explanation of the problem, click the red "Errors"
button that appears at the bottom of the task &amp; schedule window.

<h3><a name="para_2_6_6_"></a>2.6.6. Creating a schedule step by step</h3>

<p>The Task &amp; Schedule tool tries to make entering all the data necessary 
for project planning and tracking as painless as possible.  It fills in many 
of the columns automatically. The following discussion will show how to 
create a schedule step by step.</p>

<h4><a name="para_2_6_6_1_"></a>2.6.6.1. Step 1: Add tasks to the task list</h4>

<p>To create a schedule, you decide what tasks you want included in the 
schedule, and add them with the Add Task button. You can add any node in 
your hierarchy to the task list; it will be added, along with all its 
children, recursively. As an improvement over the traditional task planning 
template, the dashboard displays your task list in a hierarchical fashion. 
You can expand and contract this hierarchical view to get coarser- or 
finer-grained data. </p>

<h5 NO_NUMBER>The relationship between the Hierarchy Editor and the
Task &amp; Schedule tool</h5>

<p>All the tasks that are to be tracked within the schedule must come
from your the project hierarchy, as defined in the 
<a href="#doc28_top">hierarchy editor</a>. If you edit
your hierarchy in the future, your changes will automatically
propagate into affected task lists. For example, if you add a node
named &quot;Release 3.0&quot; to a task list, then in the future if
you were to create/delete subtasks underneath &quot;Release 3.0&quot;,
they would automatically appear in the task list / disappear from the
task list.</p>

<p>Changes made in the hierarchy automatically get reflected into the 
schedule, because the schedule is basically a listing of the tasks/projects 
in the dashboard.  However, if you remove a task in the Task &amp; Schedule 
tool, it does <i>NOT</i> get deleted from the task hierarchy of the process 
dashboard (as defined using the <a href="Topics/Planning/UsingHierarchyEditor">Hierarchy 
Editor</a>).  All you will have done is removed the task from the schedule, 
not deleted it entirely from the dashboard.  Deletion of tasks or projects 
from the dashboard itself must be done from the 
<a href="#doc28_top">Hierarchy Editor</a>.</p>

<h5 NO_NUMBER>Editing the task list</h5>

<p>Once you have added tasks to the task list, you can use the Remove
Task button to remove them.  If you remove a <U>top-level</U> task, it
will be removed from the task list entirely.  (Top-level tasks are the
tasks that you explicitly added using the Add Task button; in the task
list, they appear as immediate children of the root of the tree.)  If
you remove a <u>child</u> of a top-level task, it will be
&quot;pruned&quot; out of the task list hierarchy, along with all of
its children.  You can highlight any pruned task (including children
of a pruned task) and click the Restore Task button to add it back to
the task list.</p>

<p>The planned completion dates displayed in the task list are based
upon the order you plan to complete the tasks.  It is unlikely that
you plan to complete the tasks in the order they appear in the
hierarchy.  Therefore, there are two ways to indicate the planned
order of tasks.  First, you can change the relative order of top-level
tasks by highlighting them and using the Move Task Up/Down buttons.
For more fine-grained control, check the Flat View checkbox.  This
will replace the hierarchical view of the task list with a flat view
of the &quot;leaf&quot; tasks that have not yet been completed.  You
can then use the Move Task Up/Down buttons to reorder these tasks.
You should generally try to put the tasks in chronological order (the
first task in the list should be the one you plan to work on first,
and so on).</p>

<H4><a name="para_2_6_6_2_"></a>2.6.6.2. Step 2: Estimate task time </H4>

<P>Once tasks are added to the task list, the dashboard will look up 
information like the planned time, actual time, etc. from the appropriate 
Project Plan Summary forms (if applicable), and display it in the 
appropriate boxes. You can click on any value with a yellow background and 
edit it, and the change will appear immediately on the associated Project 
Plan Summary form.  Similarly, if you edit one of these values on a Project 
Plan Summary form, the new value will automatically appear here in the task 
list.</P>

<h5 NO_NUMBER><A NAME="doc33_loe"></A>Level of Effort Tasks</h5>

<P>Often, you may find that you are required to perform
&quot;overhead&quot; tasks, like reading email or attending meetings.
Or, you may be assigned to some ongoing responsibility like keeping
the server running, or monitoring the quality of your team's software
modules.  These tasks are ongoing, and usually have no beginning and
no end.  It doesn't make sense to say that you could ever
&quot;complete&quot; such a task.  In general, you'll spend some
percentage of your available time working on these tasks.  Because of
this, it is generally not possible to estimate how many hours and
minutes of your time the task will require.  If the project lasts one
month, you might spend 10 hours during that time period reading email
- but if the project lasts two months, you'll spend 20 hours.  Because
of this, traditional PSP earned value techniques tell you not to
include these tasks on your task list at all.</p>

<p>The Process Dashboard includes an innovative feature that makes it
easy to include these &quot;level of effort&quot; tasks on your task
list.  Add the task to your task list as usual, and in the
&quot;Planned Time&quot; column, enter a percentage.  For example, if
you think you'll spend 5% of your time reading email, you can add a
task to your task list called &quot;reading email,&quot; and enter
&quot;5%&quot; in the planned time column.  If you indicate that a
particular task is a level of effort task, all of its subtasks will be
considered level of effort tasks as well.</p>

<p>&quot;Level of effort&quot; tasks in your task list will display
differently from regular tasks.  For example, the actual time for
these tasks will be displayed as a percentage (so you can quickly
learn how much time you really spend in meetings!).  Level of effort
tasks do not earn any value, since it doesn't make sense to mark them
&quot;complete.&quot; For the same reason, these tasks will not
contain plan/actual completion dates or percent complete/spent
values.</p>


<H4><a name="para_2_6_6_3_"></a>2.6.6.3. Step 3: Estimate calendar time</H4>

<P>To generate a schedule, the dashboard needs to know how much time you plan 
to spend working on these tasks, and when you plan to spend it. This 
information is displayed in the bottom portion of the window. Each row in the 
table represents a time period. These time periods are consecutive; each time 
period begins when the previous time period ends.</P>

<P>Think about how much time you have available to work on the tasks listed 
in your task list. Describe a time period by entering the dates it will start 
and stop, and in the "PT" (Planned Time) column enter the number of hours you 
think you can spend during that time period.</P>

<P>Most of the time people have fairly predictable schedules - for example, 
you might say "I'm going to spend 20 hours a week on this until it gets 
done." Since this is the most common situation, the schedule will, by 
default, grow automatically to meet the demand. You don't have to manually 
add rows to your schedule until there are enough hours to cover the tasks - 
instead, the schedule template will automatically duplicate the final row in 
the table until there are enough hours. You can easily see where the 
automatic portion of the schedule starts because the automatic rows are 
displayed with a medium gray font. Thus, the black rows in the schedule 
template are rows that you have manually created/edited, and the gray rows 
are the ones which have been automatically added to meet the time 
requirements.</p>

<p>If you have any &quot;level of effort&quot; tasks in your task
list, you'll notice that there are two planned time columns - one for
total planned time, and one for planned &quot;direct&quot time.  Once
you enter how much total time you plan to spend in a period, it will
automatically subtract out time for the level of effort tasks, and
display the remaining time in the &quot;PDT&quot; column.  As your
schedule progresses, you'll also be able to see how much time you're
spending on these &quot;indirect&quot; tasks by looking in the
&quot;%I&quot; column.</p>


<p><center><img src="Images/TaskScheduleTimes.png"></center></p>

<p><A NAME="doc33_shortSchedule"></A>You can disable this automatic schedule 
expansion simply by making the final manual row in your schedule contain zero 
planned hours.  The dashboard recognizes that infinite duplications of the 
"zero" row will not help you get any more hours, so it leaves the schedule 
short and assigns some of your tasks the planned completion date of 
"never".</p>

<P>As in the task list, editable cells have a yellow background.  Since time 
periods are contiguous, editing the "To" value on one row will cause the 
"From" value on the following row to change accordingly.  Similarly, editing 
the "From" value on one row will cause the "To" value on the previous row to 
change. If you make changes to the last black row (which is used as a 
template and copied to make all the subsequent gray rows), all of the gray 
rows will be regenerated accordingly. If you edit a value in one of the gray 
rows, it (and all of the rows before it) will become "real", and the row in 
question will become the new "template row" upon which subsequent gray rows 
will be based.</P>

<P>If you need to extend the schedule past its optimal completion date, click 
the Add Row button to create a new row at the bottom of your schedule. The 
Insert Row button will split the currently selected time period into two 
separate rows, while the Delete Row will merge the currently selected time 
period with the one that follows it. Note that it isn't possible to delete 
an automatically generated row. If you want to to force your schedule to 
end early, you should do so by entering 0 planned hours for the final time 
period, as described <A HREF="#doc33_shortSchedule">above</A>.</P>

<h3><a name="para_2_6_7_"></a>2.6.7. Prediction Ranges in the Task &amp; Schedule Tool</h3>

<p>The task and schedule tool has always been capable of calculating
metrics that help you determine whether your project is on cost and
under budget.  The three metrics that are the most useful for this
purpose are:<ul>

<li><b>Forecast Cost</b>: Estimates the hours of effort your total
  project will require.</li>

<li><b>Forecast Completion Date</b>: Estimates the date you will most
  likely finish the project, if you continue to make progress in a manner
  similar to the work you have completed so far.</li>

<li><b>Optimized Forecast Completion Date</b>: This forecast only
  appears when you are rolling up schedules from more than one person.
  It estimates the date you could most likely finish the project, if
  future progress is similar to past progress, and if you are able to
  optimally rebalance the overall workload.</li>

</ul>

In general, these metrics are calculated using standard earned value
formulas that can be found in project management textbooks.</p>

<p>But the dashboard also contains a powerful new feature: it can
calculate prediction ranges for these forecast values.  <b>This is an
innovation developed by the Process Dashboard team.</b> Since these
calculations are new and innovative, the formulas and algorithms are
not widely known.  Discriminating users such as yourself will want to
understand how these values are calculated before trusting/accepting
them, so the algorithms are described below.</p>

<p>One important point is definitely worth noting.  In the book,
<i>A&nbsp;Discipline for Software Engineering</i>, Watts Humphrey
describes methods for calculating prediction intervals that attempt to
be 100% &quot;statistically valid.&quot; Unfortunately, the methods
described by Watts tend to break down when applied to the data that
appears in an earned value schedule, so different statistical
approaches must be applied instead.</p>

<p>Some of the algorithms used by the dashboard to calculate earned
value ranges require a non-statistical approximation to be made as
part of the calculations.  This approximation may slightly increase
the percentage error of the calculated range.  In general, the
variance introduced by this approximation is much smaller than the
variances that are present in a typical software engineering project,
so the approximation is mathematically acceptable.  Also, the
approximation will cause the dashboard to err on the side of producing
more conservative (&quot;wider&quot;) forecast ranges.  But the bottom
line is that you should not treat the calculated ranges as being
&quot;statistically valid;&quot; instead, you should view them as
being &quot;engineering approximations.&quot;</p>

<p><b>And as always, any forecast or prediction based on historical
data should only be trusted if the future work is similar to the
completed work.  If you have reason to believe that the estimates made
for future tasks are fundamentally different than the estimates made
for tasks that have been completed, you should use the resulting
forecasts with extreme caution, if at all.</b></p>

<h4 NO_NUMBER>Forecast Cost Range</h4>

<p>Traditional earned value calculations generate forecast total cost
based on the assumption that the cost performance index (CPI) for
<u>completed</u> tasks is a predictor of the CPI for the
<u>remaining</u> tasks.  To calculate the forecast cost range for a
schedule, the dashboard simply analyzes how the completed tasks have
varied around the current CPI, and uses that information to estimate
the potential variability of the CPI for the remaining tasks.</p>

<p>Specifically, the dashboard examines the relationship between
&quot;Planned Direct Time&quot; and &quot;Actual Direct Time&quot; for
all of the tasks in your task list that have been <b>completed</b>.  A
scatterplot of these points is created, and a line is fit to these
points. <!-- Since PSP earned value analysis encourages individuals to
subdivide tasks until they are around 10 hours each, the best fit line
becomes meaningless (it would generally be nearly vertical around the
&quot;x&nbsp;=&nbsp;10&nbsp;hours&quot; line, and its exact slope and
position can vary dramatically based upon how the tasks are
subdivided).  Instead, a line is fitted to the points by forcing the
intercept to zero and the slope to the reciprocal of the schedule's
cost performance index (this is the approximation described in the
disclaimer above). --> The sum-squared variance of the points from the
line is then used to calculate a prediction interval based upon a
students-T distribution with n-2 degrees of freedom (where n is the
number of completed tasks).  Finally, the double-sided interval with
probability 70% is used to calculate upper and lower ranges for CPI.
This CPI range is applied to the original estimates for the tasks in
the schedule that have not yet been completed, and the actual times
for completed tasks are added back in to generate the upper and lower
boundaries of a range that approximates 70% probability for total
cost.</p>

<p>To generate the forecast cost range for a rolled-up/team schedule,
the dashboard uses a monte-carlo simulation with several hundred
trials, and sums up the forecast costs of each subschedule for each
trial.</p>

<h4 NO_NUMBER>Forecast Completion Date Range</h4>

<p>To calculate a accurate range estimates for the forecast completion
date, it is necessary to consider variations in both cost <b>and</b>
schedule.  Possible variations in cost are adequately described by the
probability density function of the cost range calculated above.  To
characterize schedule variations, the dashboard analyzes the completed
time periods in the schedule.  For each period, the planned direct
time is divided by the actual direct time to generate &quot;direct
time performance index&quot; (DTPI), a metric which is a
mathematically related to the &quot;time estimating error&quot; for
the period.  The dashboard then calculates a weighted log-normal mean
and standard deviation of these ratios.  A confidence interval for
this log-normal distribution is calculated using Angus's parametric
bootstrap method, providing a probability density function for
DTPI.</p>

<p>With these two probability density functions at hand, a monte-carlo
simulation is once again used to characterize the range of the
forecast completion date.  In each trial, a total cost is randomly
generated from the total cost probability density function, and a DTPI
is randomly generated from the DTPI probability density function.  A
hypothetical earned value schedule is created by copying the existing
earned value schedule.  The planned direct times for each historical
period in this trial schedule are set to the actual direct time spent
in the period, and the planned direct times for future periods are
divided by the random sample for DTPI.  Normal earned value
extrapolation techniques are then used to estimate when this
randomized hypothetical schedule would reach the given random sample
for total cost.  The resulting date is stored as a single sample for
random forecast completion date; two thousand trials are conducted to
characterize the density function for forecast completion date, and
this density function is used to generate the upper and lower
boundaries of a range that approximates 70% probability.</p>

<p>To generate forecast completion date ranges for rolled-up/team
schedules, monte-carlo simulations are used once again.  In each
trial, each subschedule is randomly seeded using the approach
described above, yielding a random forecast completion date for each
subschedule.  In the dashboard, &quot;Forecast Completion Date&quot;
is the date the schedule is projected to complete if no rebalancing is
performed, so the chronologically latest of these dates in a given
trial becomes a single random sample for forecast team completion
date.  &quot;Optimized Forecast Completion Date&quot; instead takes
each of the randomized hypothetical subschedules and rolls them
together to create a single team schedule.  This randomized
hypothetical team schedule is then extrapolated to determine when the
random total forecast cost would be reached; the resulting
extrapolation becomes a single random sample for optimized forecast
team completion date.  Several hundred trials are performed to
characterize the probability distribution functions for &quot;Forecast
Completion Date&quot; and &quot;Optimized Forecast Completion
Date,&quot; and these density functions are used to generate the upper
and lower boundaries of ranges that approximate 70% probability.</p>

<h4><a name="para_2_6_7_1_"></a>2.6.7.1. <a name="doc34_when"></a>When are Prediction Ranges Calculated?</h4>

<p>The dashboard can only calculate prediction ranges if:

<ul>
<li>You have completed at least three tasks in your task list, and</li>
<li>You have completed at least three periods in your schedule.</li>
</ul>

When calculating a rolled-up team schedule, each subschedule will need
to meet these criteria before prediction ranges can be calculated for
the team schedule.</p>

<p>After calculating a prediction range, the dashboard applies several
heuristic tests to determine its validity.  If any of these tests
indicates that the prediction range is not viable, it will be
discarded and no range will be displayed on the chart.</p>

<p>Therefore, if ranges are not displayed for your schedule, it does
not indicate an error - it just indicates that the data in your
schedule can not be used to calculate a meaningful prediction range.</p>

<P>The <a href="#doc32_top">task and schedule tool</a>
contains built-in support for collaboration; just click the
Collaborate button on the Task &amp; Schedule dialog.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/TaskScheduleCollaborationButton.png"></center></p>

<p>The &quot;Task and Schedule Collaboration Wizard&quot; will
appear.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/TaskScheduleCollab.png"></center></p>

<p>The task &amp; schedule tool supports two different types of
collaboration.  It allows you to <a href="#doc35_publishing">publish</a> a
schedule (so other people can see it), and it allows you to <a href="#doc35_rollup">roll-up</a> individual schedules to create a team
schedule.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> These collaboration features will typically only work
within a local area network.  In addition, they only work when the
dashboard is running.  See the <a href="#doc35_limitations">limitations</a>
section below for more information.</p>

<hr>

<h4><a name="para_2_6_8_1_"></a>2.6.8.1. <a name="doc35_publishing"></a>Publishing Schedules</h4>

<p>Publishing a schedule opens up permissions so other people can view
the HTML earned value report. This is a great way to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Let co-workers who depend on your work know when they can expect
    it to be completed.</li>
  <li>Keep your manager or your customer apprised of your progress.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="doc35_publishPassword"></a>To publish your schedule, open it and
click on the Collaborate button. Then, click the Publish button. The
dashboard will give you an opportunity to set a password. Setting a
password prevents other people from viewing this schedule unless they
know the password. If this isn't a concern to you, you can choose not
to require a password. Passwords are set on a schedule-by-schedule
basis, so you can set different passwords for different schedules, or
set the password on one schedule but not another.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/TaskScheduleCollabPassword.png"></center></p>

<p><a name="doc35_publishFinish"></a>The dashboard will save your password
settings as soon as you click the Next button. It will then display a
final screen containing the URL, username, and password of the
published schedule. People will need this information to view the

them. A hyperlink is provided that will help you to write an email
containing this information.</p>

<p>If you forget the URL or the password in the future, you can walk
through this process again.  Reopen the schedule, click the
Collaborate and Publish buttons, and you'll see the password screen
containing the configuration you set earlier. You can edit the
password settings if you wish, and your changes will be saved - or you
can just click Next without changing the password settings.  You will

<h4><a name="para_2_6_8_2_"></a>2.6.8.2. <a name="doc35_rollup"></a>Rolling Up Schedules</h4>

<p>When two or more people are working on a project together, it is
very helpful to roll up each person's individual schedule to create a
team schedule. Creating a team schedule has many benefits:</p>

<ul>

  <li>It helps you to <b>track team progress</b>. You can easily
    determine whether the project is ahead or behind schedule, and
    over or under budget.</li>

  <li>It helps you to <b>forecast</b> the date when the overall
    project will most likely complete, as well as the total cost of
    the finished project.</li>

  <li>It helps to <b>balance the project workload</b>. Despite your
    best planning efforts, you usually find that someone on the team
    has too many tasks assigned to them. Reassigning tasks so that
    everyone is forecast to finish at the same time is called
    &quot;balancing the schedule.&quot;</li>

</ul>

<p>Rolling up schedules is a two-step process: first, each individual
must &quot;<a href="#doc35_sharing">share</a>&quot; their schedule. Then,
someone must create a master &quot;<a href="#doc35_createRollup">roll-up</a>&quot;
schedule.</p>

<h5 NO_NUMBER><a name="doc35_sharing"></a>Sharing Schedules</h5>

<p><a name="doc35_sharePassword"></a>To share your schedule, open it and
click on the Collaborate button. Then, click the Share button. The
dashboard will give you an opportunity to set a sharing
password. Setting a password prevents other people from adding this
schedule to a master schedule unless they know the password. If this
isn't a concern to you, you can choose not to require a
password. Passwords are set on a schedule-by-schedule basis, so you
can set different passwords for different schedules, or set the
password on one schedule but not another.</p>

<p><a name="doc35_shareFinish"></a>The dashboard will save your password
settings as soon as you click the Next button. It will then display a
final screen containing the password and the URL of the shared
schedule.  <a name="doc35_emailShareInfo"></a>You need to send this
information to the person who is creating the master
&quot;roll-up&quot; schedule. A hyperlink is provided that will help
you to email the information to that person.</p>

<p>If you forget the URL or the password in the future, you can walk
through this process again.  Reopen the schedule, click the
Collaborate and Share buttons, and you'll see the password screen
containing the configuration you set earlier. You can edit the
password settings if you wish, and your changes will be saved - but
realize that changing the password will break any roll-ups that
contain this schedule. To avoid that problem, just click Next without
changing the password settings. You will once again be given the final
screen with the URL/password, and the hyperlink you can use to email
that information.</p>

<h5 NO_NUMBER><a name="doc35_createRollup"></a>Creating a Roll-up Schedule</h5>

<p>One person on the team should create a master schedule which
roll-ups all of the individual schedules to the team level. Since that
person usually has their own individual schedule as well, the
dashboard is designed to create the rollup schedule and add their
individual schedule all in one step.</p>

<p>To create the roll-up schedule, open your personal schedule and
click the Collaborate button. Then, click the Rollup button. The
dashboard will allow you to choose a name for the resulting roll-up
schedule. When you click the Next button, the dashboard will create
the new roll-up schedule and add your personal schedule to it. When
you click the Finish button, the dashboard will open the new roll-up
schedule it just created.</p>

<p>Now, you will want to add additional schedules to the roll-up. Just
click the Add Schedule button to display the Add Schedule dialog
box. This dialog lists all of your personal schedules - you can add
one or more of them if you wish.  However, you will generally just
want to select the "Import a shared schedule..."  option. It will
prompt you for the URL and password of the shared schedule you wish to
add. This is information you need to get from your co-workers -
hopefully they emailed it to you as described
<a href="#doc35_emailShareInfo">above</a>.  Copy the information from the email
into the fields provided, and click OK. At this point, the dashboard
will connect to your co-worker's dashboard and retrieve the shared
schedule. If it cannot retrieve the shared schedule, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Contact your co-worker to make certain that they have the
    dashboard running.</li>

  <li>Double-check that they sent you the right URL and password, and
    that they haven't changed the password since they sent it to you.</li>

  <li>Try adding the shared schedule again. If these steps don't solve
    the problem, you may need to take a look at the
    <a href="#doc35_limitations">limitations</a> section below.</li>
</ul>

<p>After retrieving the shared schedule, the dashboard will give you
an opportunity to designate a &quot;local name&quot; for it. By
default, it uses the name of the remote schedule, followed by the name
of the person who created the schedule. (This allows you to tell
schedules apart, since they might otherwise have very similar names.)
The shared schedule will appear in the master schedule by the
&quot;local name&quot; you designate.</p>

<p>If you add a schedule by mistake, you can remove it by highlighting
it and clicking the Remove Schedule button.</p>

<ul>

  <li><b>Tip:</b> if someone changes the password on their shared
    schedule, you can correct the problem by removing that schedule
    from the master schedule, and adding it back again with the new
    password.</li>

  <li><b>Tip:</b> if you want to create a roll-up schedule, but you
    don't have a personal schedule to add to it, you can simply open
    an existing personal schedule, use the Collaborate button to
    create the rollup, then remove the personal schedule
    manually.</li>

</ul>

<p>The Move Schedule Up and Move Schedule Down buttons can be used to
rearrange the list of schedules. Note that this will not change any of
the roll-up calculations, since these calculations are independent of
the order of the list.</p>

<p>Your co-workers will probably want to be able to see the roll-up
schedule you just created. Simply open the roll-up schedule, click the
Collaborate button, and click Publish. See the section <a href="#doc35_publishing">above</a> on publishing for additional
instructions. It is not currently possible to add one rollup schedule
to another rollup schedule, so the Share and Rollup buttons will be
disabled when you open the &quot;Task and Schedule Collaboration
Wizard&quot; from a rollup schedule.</p>

<hr>

<h4><a name="para_2_6_8_3_"></a>2.6.8.3. <a name="doc35_limitations"></a>Constraints and Limitations</h4>

To understand the constraints of these collaboration features, it is
helpful to understand how the features work.

<p><center><img src="Images/TaskScheduleCollabArchitecture.png"></center></p>

<p>When you publish a schedule, the dashboard acts as a web server
that your co-workers can connect to with their web browser.  Their web
browser communicates to your dashboard to see the published
schedule.</p>

<p>Similarly, when you share a schedule, the dashboard acts as a
server that your co-worker's dashboard can connect to.  The dashboard
that is computing the roll-up schedule connects to your dashboard and
retrieves the latest copy of your schedule in a peer-to-peer
fashion.</p>

<p>As a result, your dashboard must be running for the collaboration
features to work.  If your dashboard is not running when a co-worker
tries to look at your published schedule, they will instead see an
error page stating "Cannot find server or DNS Error."</p>

<p>Rollup schedules keep a locally cached copy of your schedule, to
enable calculating a rollup even when your dashboard isn't running.
The rollup schedule will attempt to retrieve a recent version of your
schedule.  If your dashboard is not running, it will calculate the
rollup using the most recent version it has cached.</p>

<p>The collaboration features rely on TCP/IP connectivity and DNS resolution
to work. Because of this, you will probably need to be on the same network as
your co-worker, manager, and/or customer.  If someone is on a different
network than you (especially if there is a firewall between your computer and
theirs), they may not be able to take advantage of any collaboration
features you have enabled.</p>

<p>Most of the time, you interact with the dashboard web server by viewing
web pages that begin with "http://localhost".  This works fine when the
dashboard and the web browser are both running on the same computer. For the
collaboration features to work, however, your co-workers need a web address
that begins with the DNS name of your computer. Therefore, the dashboard
automatically ascertains the name of your computer and uses that to construct
collaboration URLs.  This process should work 99% of the time. If, however,
the dashboard deduces an incorrect name for your computer, then no one
will be able to use the collaboration URLs you send them.  If this occurs,
you should ask your system administrator for the DNS name of your computer,
and use it to set the "http.hostname" setting in your 
<a href="#doc52_top">configuration file</a>.

<H2><a name="para_2_7_"></a>2.7. <!--SEP--><a href="#doc23_top"><img border="0" class="sepnotice" src="Images/PSPDisclaimer.png"></a> <!--/SEP-->Data Freezing</H2>

<P>By default, the dashboard will "freeze" appropriate pieces of data when
the corresponding project phase is marked as completed.  The two points
where this happens are at the end of the Planning phase and at the end of
the project.</p>

<P>In PSP process levels 0.1 and above, when you are planning your project 
the dashboard will use your historical data to help you create an estimate of 
how your total time will be distributed across the process phases.  Once you 
click the completion checkbox to complete the planning phase, all your 
Planned data will be baselined. The estimates you entered for size and time, 
along with all the calculated computed data elements for estimated data, will 
be frozen so that your planned data will always stay constant (if you really 
want to know more about why this is necessary, read the <a href="#doc36_gory">gory 
details</a> section).</p>

<P>Similarly, when you mark the project complete, the To Date numbers will be 
brought up to date and frozen.  This will enable you to view this report 
again in the future without having the To Date numbers changing in the 
report.</p>

<P>One side effect of the freezing of data is that if you want to change
your time or size estimate, you will have to navigate back to the Planning
phase and mark it as incomplete by clicking the completion checkbox again.
Once it has been marked as incomplete the dashboard will allow you to enter
a different estimate.</p>

<p>The same is true of the To Date items on the report.  If you navigate back
to an old project and start logging time to it, the Actual columns will
update as required, but the To Date columns will not.  You will need to mark
the project as incomplete so that the To Date items will thaw out and
recalculate.</p>

<p>The Project Completion checkbox is located on the Project Plan Summary 
form.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/QSCheckProjectComplete.png"></center></p>

<h3 NO_NUMBER><a name="doc36_gory"></a>The gory details</h3>

<P>The "To Date" elements on the forms are set up to always recalculate 
themselves based on all the completed data in the dashboard's database.  This 
is fine for most circumstances.  However, if you ever want to go back and 
look at a Project Plan Summary form (or other report or chart) from an older 
completed project, the dashboard would recalculate those To Date elements all 
over again.  This time the calculation would include data that was not 
available at the time the project was originally finished.  This would 
preclude anyone from being able to reproduce a previous Project Plan Summary 
accurately.</p>

<P>Actually, it gets a bit worse.  Since the estimates of time spent in each 
of the process phases is based on the To Date data, all the estimates would 
be changing on those older forms as well.</p>

<p>In fact, even within a project once you had planned your estimates for 
time in the various phases, those planned times would immediately change on 
the Project Plan Summary at the end of the project when you completed it.  
If the Planned data were still live, the current project's data would be 
incorporated back into those estimates!</p>

<P>The way we chose to deal with this problem is to introduce the freezing of 
data elements.  Now, once your planning is finished the data will freeze and 
not be "corrupted" by the finishing of the current project.  Also it becomes 
possible to recreate older Project Plan Summary forms since their formulas 
won't be changing anymore.</p>

<P>If you do not desire this kind of behavior (e.g. you always want the To 
Date items to reflect the current situation) you can turn off this behavior 
by setting the <code>dataFreezing.disabled</code> option in the configuration 
file.  For more information about the configuration file and what can be set 
there, see the <a href="#doc52_top">configuration file</a> help

<P>Both the PSP and the TSP require the collection and analysis of metrics at 
a <i>very</i> fine-grained level. Once data are collected at this level, 
statistical analyses of the data permit remarkable planning, tracking, 
prediction, and control of software products and projects.</p>

<p>These metrics collection and analysis processes, however, are not trivial. 
In any real-world project, tool support for the PSP and TSP become important 
considerations. Although studies have demonstrated that people can maintain 
their productivity when using the PSP without tool support, the "frustration 
factor" inherent with such an approach tries the patience of all but the most 
disciplined engineers, making PSP behaviors difficult to sustain.</p>

<P>The Process Dashboard was designed to facilitate a solution to this 
problem.  When using the dashboard, the metrics required by the PSP can be 
measured quickly, easily, and accurately.</p>

<H2><a name="para_3_1_"></a>3.1. <!--SEP--><a href="#doc23_top"><img border="0" class="sepnotice" src="Images/PSPDisclaimer.png"></a> <!--/SEP-->Navigating the hierarchy menus</H2>

<P>The dashboard attempts to keep itself as small as possible to allow the bulk 
of precious screen real estate to be used for the actual business of software 
development.  As different sections of the project tree are selected via the 
hierarchy menus, the dashboard will automatically resize itself to accommodate
the menu depth necessary to show the chosen process phase.</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/ShowHierarchyMenus.png"></center></p>

<P>The hierarchy menus are the way you choose the current working project.  
This example shows the dashboard ready to work on the Design phase of a 
PSP0 project.  The hierarchy menus show each level in the current project 
tree all the way down to the current phase.</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/HierarchyEditor.png"></center></p>

<P>To better illustrate navigation with the hierarchy menus, this
example set of projects will be used.  The project tree is shown in a
screenshot from the hierarchy editor.  For more information on putting
together a project hierarchy and the use of the hierarchy editor see
the <a href="#doc28_top">Using the
hierarchy editor</a> help topic.</P>

<P>This project hierarchy shows two top level project categories: "Project"
and "Non Project".  These are the two categories given as default when the 
dashboard is first run.  Under "Project" there are three projects defined: 
"PSP0" and "Web project" along with a hierarchy node: "Palm".  Presumably 
this developer will be doing several projects in the future that fall under 
the logical category of "Palm".  At this point only one is shown: "Palm 
DB".  In this screenshot, only the Web project has been expanded to show its 
phases.  Phases are added into the project hierarchy as children of a 
project.  Web project was created from a PSP2.1 template, and so it has all 
the development phases of a PSP2.1 project.</P>

<P>Back on the dashboard itself, when the first hierarchy menu is selected, 
it will show all the entries in the project hierarchy that are defined at 
that level.  In this case it shows the two default nodes "Project" and "Non 
Project".</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/HierarchyMenus1.png"></center></p>

<P>Selecting the second hierarchy menu shows the entries defined at that 
level under the selection from the first menu.  In this case, the user has 
selected "Project" on the first menu, so the second menu shows the children 
of "Project" in the project hierarchy.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/HierarchyMenus2.png"></center></p>

<P>Selecting any menu in the set of hierarchy menus will show the entries 
defined as children under the selection on the menu to its left.  This final 
example shows the PSP 2.1 process phases that are defined for the "Web 
project".</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/HierarchyMenus3.png"></center></p>

<P>To help you keep track which tasks have marked complete, the hierarchy
menus display small checkmarks next to completed items. (You can mark an
item complete with the <A HREF="#doc41_top">completion checkbox</A>.)</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/HierarchyMenus4.png"></center></P>

<p>As mentioned earlier, the dashboard window will resize itself as you
navigate from task to task, keeping itself as small as possible while still
displaying the names of all the nodes for the current task.  If you find
that the dashboard is still taking up too much horizontal space, just resize
the window to be smaller.  The hierarchy menus will display as much of the
names as possible. (If you hover over a truncated name, a tool tip will
tell you the full name.)</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/ShowHierarchyMenusTruncated.png"></center></p>

<p>If you've done this by accident, and you want to see the full names again,
just resize the dashboard window to be bigger.</p>

<P>Most of the scripts necessary to perform your work are included in
an add-on module for the Process Dashboard.  In particular, the
process scripts for all of the PSP levels described in <I>A Discipline
for Software Engineering</I> are included in this optional module.  Of
course, any dashboard process (including <a href="#doc55_top">custom
processes</a>) can provide integrated process scripts to guide your work.</P>

<P>To access process scripts, hit the script button on the dashboard.</P>

<P align="center"><IMG SRC="Images/PointToScriptButton.png"></P>

<P>This will start a web browser (if necessary) and point it at an 
appropriate process script based on which process stage is currently active.</P>

<P class="ifpsp" align="center"><IMG SRC="Images/PSP0DevelopmentScript.png"></P>

<P class="ifpsp">This example shows a project calling up the
Development script for PSP level 0.</P>

<P>When you click the script button, it will generally display the script for
the phase which is currently selected by the hierarchy menus.  Most of the
online forms allow you to navigate back to the "top" of the set of process
scripts by a link labelled "Top".  Also, a link which will take you on to the
next phase in the given process is usually shown as well.</P>

<a name="doc39_scriptIcons"></a><h3><a name="para_3_2_1_"></a>3.2.1. <A NAME="doc39_pullDown"></A>The script button pull-down</h3>
<P>The script button pull-down tab allows you to choose a particular form in 
a more direct manner.  Clicking the pull-down on the forms button will bring 
up a menu of the most commonly used scripts and forms available for the current process.  Choosing 
one of these will open the named script or form.</p>

<P align="center"><img src="Images/PointToScriptPullDownShowMenu.png"></p>

<a name="doc39_scriptBrowser"></a><P>You can also select the &quot;More...&quot;
option at the bottom of the menu to bring up a script browser. The
script browser shows your hierarchy on the left; when you highlight a
node in the hierarchy, it displays the available scripts and forms on
the right. You can open one of those scripts or forms by
double-clicking on it.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="Images/ScriptBrowser.png"></p>

<P>The script browser makes it easy to pull up forms for historical
projects without first needing to navigate the hierarchy menus to that
project.</p>

<h3><a name="para_3_2_2_"></a>3.2.2. The timing icons</h3><P>Many of the process 
scripts contain little stopwatch icons on them.  These icons provide another 
way to navigate and time a process phase.  When you click on one of these 
icons, the current phase being measured will change to the phase indicated by 
the icon and the timer will start measuring time for that phase.</p>

<H3><a name="para_3_2_3_"></a>3.2.3. External documents</H3>

<P>Creating or obtaining documents is often an integral part of performing
a process. The dashboard process scripts sometimes provide hyperlinks for
these documents. If you click on a document hyperlink, the dashboard will:</p>

<OL>
  <LI>Possibly ask you for pertinent information. For example, the
    dashboard may need to know the name of a directory where it should
    store documents     for this project, and it may display a form
    requesting that information. Once you provide this information and
    click &quot;OK,&quot; the dashboard generally won't have to ask for it
    again.</LI>
  <LI>Check to see if the file already exists. If not, it may be able to
    create the file from a template.</LI>
  <LI>Open the file for editing.</LI>

<h3><a name="para_3_2_4_"></a>3.2.4. Entering data into the forms</h3>

<P>The various forms necessary to do your work have data entry fields which 
are to be used to capture the various process metrics.  The forms are 
continually "live", which means they are always ready and waiting for input.  
There is no "submit" or "send" button on the forms.  Just enter the data in 
the blanks and the dashboard will record it. Some blanks on the forms are greyed out.  These data elements are computed 
by the dashboard and do not require data input. For more information, see

<H2><a name="para_3_3_"></a>3.3. Using the play/pause button</H2>

<P>The play/pause button gives access to the timer that is built into the 
dashboard.</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/PointToPlayPauseButton.png"></center></p>

<P>The dashboard timer makes it easy to measure the amount of time spent in 
the various phases of your development process.  When you start the timer, it
will automatically make appropriate entries in your <a href="#doc42_top">time log</a> for the project/task which you
have made active with the <a href="#doc38_top">hierarchy
menus</a>.</P>

<P>By default, the play/pause button shows a triangle when the timer <em>IS 
NOT</em> running.  The intent is that the picture shows what will happen when 
it is pressed (pressing the play button will cause the timer to start).  Once 
pressed, the button image changes from the triangle to a pair of vertical 
bars.  When the vertical bars are displayed, the timer <em>IS</em> running.  
Again, the intent is to show what will happen when the button is pressed at 
this point (pressing the pause button will cause the timer to pause).</P>

<p><img src="Images/DashboardStopped.png"></p>
Dashboard timer waiting to be started

<p><img src="Images/DashboardRunning.png"></p>
Dashboard timer running

<P>If you would prefer to see the triangle when the timer <em>IS</em>
currently running (i.e. you would rather see the current state of the timer 
on the button), you can override this default behavior by adding an entry to 
the configuration file.  Adding the following line to the configuration file 
will cause the play and pause symbols to reverse their meaning:</P>

<pre>pauseButton.showCurrent=true</pre>

<P>For more information about the configuration file see the <a href="#doc52_top">configuration file</a> help 
topic.</P>

<p>It is <b>not</b> necessary to stop the timer before using the hierarchy
menus to change the active project/task/phase.  You can leave the timer in
"play" mode as you move from one phase to another, and it will properly
finalize one entry in the time log, and open another.</p>

<a name="doc40_timelogdelay"></a><p>When the timer is running and you first navigate
to an activity, you will notice that the dashboard will not create an entry in
the time log until you have spent a full minute there; this is by design.
Navigating from one task to another may require multiple interactions with the
hierarchy menus, which necessarily implies that the "active" project/task will
momentarily pass through several intermediate states before finally arriving at
the desired task.  You would <u>not</u> want the dashboard to create extraneous
entries in the time log for all those intermediate tasks; therefore, the
dashboard waits and creates the time log entry only after you have logged 60
seconds worth of elapsed time to an activity.</p>

<a name="doc40_sound"></a><P>When you start the timer, it will make a short 
"clicking" sound to let you know it is timing you.  You can leave the timer 
running as you move from phase to phase and project to project, and it will 
play the "timing sound" as you navigate to each new project/phase.  Once 
again, the sound is there to remind you that the dashboard is timing you; the 
sound will <b>not</b> play if the timer is not running.  Therefore, as you 
move from one project/phase to another, if you expect to hear the sound and 
do not (or vice versa), check the state of the timer.</p>

<a name="doc40_pullDown"></a><h3><a name="para_3_3_1_"></a>3.3.1. The play/pause button pull-down control</h3>
<P>The play/pause button contains a pull-down control that can be used to
quickly jump to a point on the project tree where you have recently recorded
time.  This provides another way of navigating to a project or project phase
in which you were recently working.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/PointToPlayPausePullDownShowMenu.png"></center></p>

<P>In this example, the dashboard has already recorded time in both the 
Design and Planning phases of the project.  If one of these items is chosen, 
the dashboard will jump to that phase and continue.  If the timer is 
currently running it will stop in the current phase recording the elapsed 
time, switch to the chosen phase, and start recording time in the newly 
chosen phase.</p>

<!-- DISCLAIMER -->

<P>The items in the pull-down are not limited to the phases of the current
project. Therefore, the pull-down control is very useful when you are
juggling several activities. If you keep bouncing back and forth between
several unrelated activities, you can quickly jump to a recent activity and
log time there by using the pull-down menu.</P>

<H2><a name="para_3_4_"></a>3.4. Using the completion checkbox</H2>

<P>As you complete the activities for a given process phase, you should mark
that phase as completed via the completion checkbox.</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/PointToCompletionButton.png"></center></p>

<P>When the completion checkbox is pressed, the dashboard moves the current 
phase to the next phase prescribed by the running process template.  If the 
timer is currently running, it will automatically stop recording time for the 
given phase and start the timing of the next phase.  For more information on 
using the timer, see the <a href="#doc40_top">Using the Play/Pause 
button</A> help topic.</P>

<P>Phases marked as complete will show a little checkmark in the completion 
checkbox.  (If you hover the mouse over the checked box, the tooltip will tell
you exactly what date and time the phase was marked complete.)</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/ShowCheckedCompletionButton.png"></center></p>

<P>This example shows the Design phase of a PSP0 project marked as 
complete.</P>

<P>If you need to go back to a previous phase in a given process, you can 
still do so even if the completion checkbox has been pressed. The dashboard 
will still accumulate time in whatever phase you make current.</P>

<h3 NO_NUMBER>Marking a <i>phase</i> complete vs marking the
<i>project</i> complete</h3>

<p>By default, a project will be considered complete when all the phases in 
the project have been marked complete. However, if you manually edit the 
project completion date on the plan summary form (either via the input field 
or the checkbox), then you have manually overridden this behavior. From then 
on, the project completion status must be edited manually; it will no longer 
respond to changes in phase completion status. (Actually, you can restore the 
default behavior by typing <code><b>DEFAULT</b></code> in the project 
completion date input field on the plan summary form.)</p>

<h3 NO_NUMBER>Why should I bother marking the phases/projects complete?</h3>

<P>It is worth remembering that the "To Date" data entries, the data analysis
reports, and the PROBE tool only use data from projects that are marked
complete, so it is good to make a habit of marking your projects complete,
either with the completion checkbox or via the Project Plan Summary form.</p>

<P>Also remember that the task and schedule tool tracks your progress by
looking to see which tasks have been marked complete, so it is good to make a 
habit of marking phases complete. To help you keep track of what has and 
hasn't been marked complete, the hierarchy menus will display a checkmark to 
the right of completed tasks.</p>

<H2><a name="para_3_5_"></a>3.5. Using the time log editor</H2>

<P>You can use the time log editor to correct mistakes you might make when 
timing your activities.  The time log editor can be opened by selecting the
"Time Log" option on the <a href="#doc45_top">configure menu</a>.</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/TimeLogEditor.png"></center></p>

<h3><a name="para_3_5_1_"></a>3.5.1. Project hierarchy</h3>
<P>The left pane shows the current project hierarchy.  Selecting various 
branches on the hierarchy will limit the time entries displayed to just those 
on the branch chosen.</P>

<P>Next to the name of each hierarchy node, the dashboard displays the total
amount of time that has been logged against that node and all its children.
If you apply a date filter (see below), these times will recalculate based on
the filtered view of the time log.  You can use the "Time Format" pulldown
control to display these times in hours:minutes, decimal hours, or percentages
(of either the total time, or the time logged to the parent of the node).</P>

<a name="doc42_dateFilter"></a><h3><a name="para_3_5_2_"></a>3.5.2. Date filter</h3>
<P>Above the split pane is a set of controls that provide date filtering on 
the time entries display.  Once the desired span of dates has been chosen, 
clicking the "Apply Filter" button will restrict the data shown to the range 
of dates specified.</p>

<P>The Apply Filter button has a pulldown control that provides for several 
common date filters.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/ShowTimeLogFilterPullDown.png"></center></p>

<P>To the left of the "From" entry box and the right of the "To" entry box 
are double arrowed buttons.  These buttons will jump the date filtering 
forward and backward by a unit of time equal to the current filtering date 
range.  For example, if you have filtered the data in the Time Log such that 
only one week of data is showing, pressing these buttons will cause the 
filtering to move backward or forward by one week at a time.</p>

<P>The "From" and "To" entry boxes are places where specific dates can be 
entered.  The format of the date entry depends upon Java localization 
settings, which can be overridden by an entry in the configuration file.</P>

<h3><a name="para_3_5_3_"></a>3.5.3. Time entries</h3>
<P>To change data in the time entries, just pick on the element that you would
like to change.  The elements in the time entries pane are editable.  The
"Logged To" column shows the process phase to which the time was logged.  If
you edit values in this column, you must type the name of a hierarchy phase
exactly;  capitalization, spacing, etc. are all significant.  If you type an
invalid value, the editor will restore the original value. The "Start T"
column shows the start time for the activity.  The "Delta" column shows the
length of time spent in the activity.  The "Int" column shows the amount of
time that the given activity was interrupted.</P>

<h3><a name="para_3_5_4_"></a>3.5.4. Control buttons</h3>
<P>The Add and Delete buttons allow the addition and deletion of time 
entries.  When Add is chosen, by default the last entry in the time log will 
be copied into a new log entry.  You can choose which entry will be copied to 
make the new time entry by picking one of the entries before clicking the Add 
button, or by highlighting the corresponding leaf of the tree.</P>

<P>The Save and Revert buttons will save the changes or revert the entries to 
their previous values.</P>

<a name="doc42_summarize"></a><P>The Summarize button will collapse all time 
entries that were logged to the same process phase into one entry.  The 
Dashboard will create new entries each time that it starts recording time in 
a given process phase (i.e. when a process phase is left and then returned to 
again for more time measurement).  This function will allow you to collaspe 
all duplicates entries in the current display.</P>

<a name="doc42_TimeCardView"></a><p>The Time Card View button will display another 
view of the time data.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/TimeCardView.png"></center></p>

<p>The Time Card View is handy if you work for an employer that makes you 
submit time cards or time sheets.  You can open this window and refer to
the data it contains as you enter data into your employer's time card.</p>

<p>At the top left, a pulldown and a text field allow you to choose the
month and year to display.  On the left side of the window is an
abbreviated version of your hierarchy, containing only the nodes and tasks
where you logged time during the selected month.  Columns are displayed for
the days in the month; tooltips on the column headers display the
corresponding day of the week.  Cells in the table display the amount of
time logged by day and by task.</p>

<p>Two controls in the top center of the window allow you to customize the
display.  You can hide columns for days that contain no time data using the
checkbox, and you can change the display time format using the pulldown.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/ShowTimeCardFormatPullDown.png"></center></p>

<p>You can choose to display time in hours:minutes, decimal hours, or
minutes.</p>

<H2><a name="para_3_6_"></a>3.6. Entering defects</H2>

<P>We all make mistakes.  Dealing with those mistakes in a constructive way 
so that we can learn from them is a lot of what process improvement is all
about.</P>

<P>Entering defects in the dashboard is as easy as choosing the defect button.</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/PointToDefectButton.png"></center></p>

<P>When the defect button is chosen, the defect dialog pops up so that you 
can enter information about the defect that you have discovered.</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/EnterDefect.png"></center></p>

<P>In this dialog box, you enter all the data necessary to describe the 
defect.  Each feature of the dialog box is detailed below.</P>

<h3><a name="para_3_6_1_"></a>3.6.1. Defect type</h3>
<P>The defect type pulldown allows you to choose the type of defect.  The 
choices are determined by the defect type standard that is in effect for
the currently selected project.  You can create new defect type standards,
and configure the defect type standards that should be used for various
projects;  see the <a href="#doc44_top">defect editor</a>
help topic for more information.</P>

<a name="doc43_fixDefects"></a><h3><a name="para_3_6_2_"></a>3.6.2. "fix defects"</h3>
<P>The "Fix Defect" entry is where you can put the ID number of another 
defect if this is a "fix defect".  A fix defect is a defect that was 
injected while fixing another defect.  In order to determine the ID number of 
the other defect, you can pull up the defect editor by choosing "Defect Log"
on the "C" menu.  One of the columns of information about each defect will 
show the ID number.  For more information about using the Defect Log see the 
<a href="#doc44_top">Using the defect log editor</a> help 
topic.</P>

<P>The "new fix defect" button to the right of the ID entry provides another 
way to enter a fix defect.  Consider the following relatively common case.  
You are fixing a bug (so you already have the defect dialog open and it is 
timing your fix).  You edit your code and save the changes.  You compile and 
link to run a test to verify your fix.  Immediately you notice that your fix 
broke something else.  At this point, you can click the new fix defect button 
to get a second defect dialog (to enter this new defect).  This second dialog 
will have the ID number of the previous defect already entered in the ID 
entry blank.  You can now input data relating to this new fix defect. The 
following screenshot shows two defect dialogs open.  The second dialog (the 
one on top) is being used to enter a fix defect.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/QSTwoDefectDialogs.png"></center></p>

<p>This process works with defects that you edit from within the defect log 
editor as well.  See the section below on <a href="#doc43_fixingMultipleDefects">fixing multiple defects</a> for more discussion 
on having two defect dialogs open at once.</P>


<h3><a name="para_3_6_3_"></a>3.6.3. Phase injected and phase removed</h3>
<P>The defect injected and defect removed pulldowns allow selection of the 
phases in which the defect was injected and removed, respectively.  The 
dashboard will set both of these to what it thinks are appropriate choices 
given the current development phase, but that default choice can be 
overridden easily.</P>

<a name="doc43_timing"></a><h3><a name="para_3_6_4_"></a>3.6.4. Timing the defect fix</h3>
<P>The defect dialog has its own built in timer independent of the main 
dashboard timer.  By default, when the dialog first appears, it starts timing 
the fix of the defect.  The fix time display will show the time passing.  The 
intent of this behavior is that most people will discover a defect, push the 
defect button on the dashboard and immediately start fixing the defect.  In 
this scenario, the dialog will immediately start timing the fix.  This 
behavior can be changed via an entry in the configuration file.  Adding the 
following line to the configuration file will cause the dashboard to appear 
without starting the defect timer.</P>

<PRE>defectDialog.autostart=false</PRE>

<P>For more information about the configuration file see the <a href="#doc52_top">configuration file</a> help 
topic.</P>

<P>The timer start/stop button allows starting and stopping of the defect 
timer.  If you stop fixing the given defect but are not finished with the 
fix, you can press this button to stop the timer.</P>

<P>In any case, you can stop the timer and enter a specific time in the fix 
time display box.</P>

<h3><a name="para_3_6_5_"></a>3.6.5. Entering a description</h3>
<P>The defect description pane is where you record a description of the defect.</P>

<a name="doc43_fixingMultipleDefects"></a><h3><a name="para_3_6_6_"></a>3.6.6. Fixing multiple defects at a time</h3>

<P>If you have the need to fix more than one defect at one time, you can do 
so by simply pushing the defect button on the dashboard again to display 
another defect dialog.  When this happens, the timer on the first dialog will 
stop (if it was running) and the new defect dialog's timer will start 
recording time for the new defect.  This new defect will become the "current"
defect.  When this new defect dialog is dismissed, the most previously opened 
defect dialog will become the current defect.  It will pop to the front and 
its timer will start up again (if it had been running previously).</P>

<P>In this way you can keep an arbitrary number of defect dialogs open at 
once.  If this is to be done, we recommend that you enter a description of 
the defect into the dialog box as soon as it is opened so that when it comes 
back to the front as the currently active defect, it will be clear what you 
were working on.</P>

<H2><a name="para_3_7_"></a>3.7. Using the Defect Log Editor</H2>

<P>You can use the defect log editor to correct mistakes you might make when 
entering defects.  The defects log editor can be opened by selecting the
"Defect Log" option on the <a href="#doc45_top">configure menu</a>.</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/DefectLogEditor.png"></center></p>


<P>The left pane shows the current project hierarchy.  Picking various 
branches on the hierarchy will limit the defect entries displayed to just 
those on the branch chosen.</P>

<P>To change data in the defect entries, just pick on the element that you 
would like to change.  When a particular defect entry is picked, the Edit 
button becomes active.  Clicking the Edit button will bring up the same 
dialog box used to enter defects.  All the defect data can be changed using 
this dialog.  For help using the defect entry dialog please see the <a href="#doc43_top">Entering defects</A> help topic.</P>

<h3><a name="para_3_7_1_"></a>3.7.1. Configuring Defect Type Standards</h3>

<p>The dashboard will allow you to configure the &quot;defect type
standards&quot; that you would like to use for various projects.

<P>Defect type standards are associated with projects hierarchically.
By default, projects just inherit the standard chosen by their parent.
In addition, there is a &quot;global default&quot; defect type
standard that is inherited when no other settings have been chosen.

<P>As you select various branches in the project hierarchy, a
component at the bottom of the left pane will show you the defect type
standard setting in effect for the highlighted branch.  You can select

<P>Just as it is necessary to plan a software project, it is also 
advantageous to learn from the experience of a software project as well.  In 
the PSP course, a lot of postmortem time is spent calculating the various 
metrics and recording them.  The Process Dashboard will take away much of the 
tedium associated with a Postmortem analysis.</p>

<P>For the most part, the work involved in a postmortem for a project that 
uses the Process Dashboard is automated.  The dashboard knows how to fill out 
the Project Plan Summary form with all the derived metrics that are a part of 
the PSP, and it also knows how to create many helpful graphs to let you get a 
visual feel for how the data look.</p>

<p>The main thing that isn't done automatically is the final LOC counts.
You can use the built-in <A HREF="#doc47_top">LOC counter</A>, or an
external LOC counter of your own choosing, to calculate LOC; then enter 
the final counts on the Project Plan Summary form (for PSP levels 0 and 0.1) 
and on the Size Estimating Template (for PSP levels 1 through 3).</p>

</div>

<H2><a name="para_4_1_"></a>4.1. <!--SEP--><a href="#doc23_top"><img border="0" class="sepnotice" src="Images/PSPDisclaimer.png"></a> <!--/SEP-->Counting LOC</H2>

<p>Measuring size is an important step in the PSP Postmortem phase. If you 
don't pause in your project postmortem to measure the number of added, 
deleted, and modified LOC, you may forever lose the opportunity to capture 
these metrics. It only takes a few moments, and provides you with valuable 
data for future planning efforts.</p>

<P>You may already have a LOC counter that you use on a regular basis. (In 
fact, most people who complete the PSP training course write a LOC counter 
during the training.) If you do need a LOC counter, one is built into the 
dashboard.</p>

<p class="unlesspsp">You can access this LOC counter by pointing your
web browser at <u>http://localhost:2468/dash/pspdiff.htm</u>.</p>

<p class="ifpsp">A link to this LOC counter is included in the
Postmortem scripts for PSP0.1 and up.</P>

<p class="ifpsp" align="center"><img src="Images/PspDiffLink.png"></p>

<P>The built-in LOC counter helps to determine the number of physical LOC 
that you have added, deleted, and modified. It also displays a "redlined"
version of the program file, which can be <I>very</I> useful for peer 
reviews.</P>

<P>If you want to measure the size of a newly created file, just leave the 
"Initial File" section blank, and put the newly created file in the "Modified 
File" section.</P>

<P>The LOC counter that is built into the Process Dashboard is extendable to 
allow user defined LOC counting rules.  Methods for writing your own LOC 
counting code that can work with the Process Dashboard will be detailed in 
the <I>Process Authoring Manual</I> when it becomes available on our 
website.</P>

<H2><a name="para_4_2_"></a>4.2. <!--SEP--><a href="#doc23_top"><img border="0" class="sepnotice" src="Images/PSPDisclaimer.png"></a> <!--/SEP-->Data charts and reports</H2>

<P>The Process Dashboard automates many reports and charts that can be quite 
useful in a project postmortem.</p>

<h3><a name="para_4_2_1_"></a>4.2.1. The Project Plan Summary</h3>
<P>The main report that contains the most useful postmortem information for 
your project will probably be the Project Plan Summary form.  The Project 
Plan Summary can generally be produced by navigating to the project for which 
you would like the report, clicking the drop down list to the right of the
scripts button, and selecting the option for the Project Plan Summary 
form.</p>

<P><center><img src="Images/PointToHierarchyMenusAndScriptsButton.png"></center></p>

<h3><a name="para_4_2_2_"></a>4.2.2. Marking your project complete</h3>
<P>It is important to mark your project as complete.  This lets the dashboard
know that you are finished with the project, and it can use the project data to
calculate the various items in the reports and charts.  You can edit the
project completion date via the appropriate field on the Project Plan Summary.
If you haven't edited the project completion date field on the Project Plan
Summary, marking all the phases in the project complete will mark the project
complete as well.</p>

<P><center><img src="Images/PointToCompletionButton.png"></center></p>

<h3><a name="para_4_2_3_"></a>4.2.3. The Time Log and Defect Log</h3>
<P>HTML versions of the Time Log and the Defect Log are also available from 
the scripts button.  If you navigate to the main Process script for any of 
the PSP processes (usually by following a link marked "top" near the bottom 
of the various reports and forms), you will links named "Time Log" and 
"Defect Log" in the text of the script.  These will bring up a read-only 
version of the two logs.</p>

<a name="doc48_charts"></a><h3><a name="para_4_2_4_"></a>4.2.4. Graphical charts</h3>
<P>The dashboard also makes many graphical charts of various kinds 
available.  Choosing Data Analysis from the C menu will bring up a split view 
that contains an index of various chart types on the left and thumbnails of 
the charts available on the right.  Clicking any of the thumbnail charts will 
bring up a full-sized version of the chart.  When viewing a full-sized chart,
resizing your browser window will cause the chart to resize as well.  Finally,
clicking on a full-sized chart will display a table of the data used to draw
that chart.</p>

<P><center><img src="Images/DataAnalysisScreen.png"></center></p>

<p>The dashboard provides charts that allow</p>

<UL>
 <LI>Defect analysis - rates of injection and removal of defects in the 
   different process phases, defect injection and removal percentages in the 
   different process phases, and pie charts showing the distribution of defect 
   types.</LI>
 <LI>Plan analysis - comparisons of planned time and size with actual planned 
   time and size, planning error of both time and size, and breakdowns of the 
   amount of time spent in the different development phases.</LI>
 <LI>Process analysis - comparisons of productivity rates, defect removal 
   yields, and appraisal to failure cost ratios.</li>
 <LI>Quality analysis - various looks at the quality metrics of defect 
   removal yield, failure and appraisal cost of quality, and LOC reviewed per 
   hour rates.</LI>
 <LI>R3 - the R3 report as called for in a PSP class.</li>
 <LI>R4 - the R4 report as called for in a PSP class.</li>
 <LI>Pareto - shows defects organized by type sorted by number and by fix 
   time.</LI>
 <LI>Custom - allows you to produce customized charts and reports based upon
   your historical data.</LI>

<H2><a name="para_4_3_"></a>4.3. Exporting your data</H2>
<P>Presently the dashboard provides two methods of exporting data to other 
applications.</p>

<h3><a name="para_4_3_1_"></a>4.3.1. Creating an ASCII flat file</h3>
<P>You can create an ASCII file of your data by choosing Export from the "C"
menu.  Doing so will bring up the following tool:</p>

<P><center><img src="Images/ExportTool-Data.png"></center></p>

<P><B><EM>NOTE: This tool will be replaced by a much more robust 
import/export capability in a future version of the dashboard and is to be 
considered a deprecated feature.</EM></B></P>

<P>The Export tool presents the project hierarchy in a pane on the left, and 
options to export either your process data or the hierarchy list.  The tool 
also provides a filtering capability via the checkboxes shown to the left of 
each of the nodes in the tree.  Nodes marked with an X will be included in 
the export.</p>

<h4><a name="para_4_3_1_1_"></a>4.3.1.1. Exporting data</h4>
<P>If you choose to export your data, only the process nodes that have 
actually measured data will be written to a file in the following format:</p>

<pre>
/complete/path/to/data/item,&lt;value&gt;
  ...
!Date &amp; Time!,&lt;number of minutes recorded&gt;
  ...
</pre>

<P>The data elements themselves will not be in any particular order, but the 
time data will be in chronological order.  This format was originally 
implemented to allow earned value tracking in an external tool and does not 
really provide a complete dump of the data in the dashboard repository.</p>

<h4><a name="para_4_3_1_2_"></a>4.3.1.2. Exporting the Hierarchy list</h4>
<P>If you choose to export the hierarchy list, the entire hierarchy tree will 
be written to a file.  The file will have the form of one entry per line in 
the following format:</p>

<pre>/complete/path/to/data/item</pre>

<a name="doc49_excel"></a><h3><a name="para_4_3_2_"></a>4.3.2. Exporting data to Excel (PC only)</h3>
<p>Many of the reporting forms in the dashboard have links that say "Export 
to Excel...".  When this link is clicked, an Excel sheet will come up that 
contains the data from that form.</p>

<P>There is a subtle difference between the way that this export is handled 
in Netscape versus the way it is handled in Internet Explorer.</p>

<ul>
 <li><B><A NAME="doc49_static">Static export</A>:</B> In Netscape, the sheet will have static data elements that contain the 
   values of the process variables at the instant that the export was 
   done.</li>
 <li><B>Dynamic export:</B> In Internet Explorer, the sheet will be a linked spreadsheet.  Excel 
   will connect to the dashboard and retrieve the data items.  Excel will 
   typically also display a floating "External data" toolbar, which can be 
   used to refresh the data (as long as the dashboard is still running).  By 
   clicking the "Data Range Properties" button on this floating toolbar, 
   Excel can be configured to refresh the data automatically whenever the 
   spreadsheet is opened.</li>
</ul>

<P>If this feature doesn't seem to be working for you, see the <A HREF="#doc50_BadExcel">related FAQ</A>.

<P>The "Export to Excel..." option will appear on 
<UL>
 <li><a href="#doc27_top">dashboard forms</a> such as
   the Project Plan Summary form</li>
 <li>tables that are displayed by clicking on a graphical chart (see <a href="#doc48_charts">Data Charts and Reports</a> for
   more information)</li>
 <li>the table that is displayed when you click on the "historical data" link 
   from a PSP1.0 or higher process script</li>
 <li>the HTML time log</li>
 <li>the HTML defect log</li>
 <li>the HTML report that is displayed when you click the
  &quot;Report&quot; button on the <A HREF="#doc32_top">task &amp; schedule tool</A></li>

<P><HR><a name="doc50_MacInstall"></a><B>How can I install the Process Dashboard on 
   a Macintosh computer?</b>

<p>At this time, we do not have very much experience with installing or 
running the Dashboard on the Macintosh.  If you are running MacOS X, go ahead 
and try the standard Unix install procedure.</p>

<p>If you have any trouble getting the Dashboard installed and running 
properly on a Mac, <b>please</b> write us an email at 
<em>processdash-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</em>!  We would very much like to 
work with you one-on-one to work things out so that we can document the 
proper procedure.</p>


<P><HR><a name="doc50_NoServer"></a><B>My web browser displays an error message 
   when I try to view a script/form/chart/report/etc.  What is wrong?</B>

<P>The dashboard actually contains a very small HTTP server that provides all
the web content and thus the content cannot be displayed when the dashboard is
not running.  If you get an error message like "The page cannot be displayed -
cannot find server" from Internet Explorer, or "Netscape is unable to locate
the server localhost" from Netscape, check to make certain that the dashboard
is running.</p>

<P>If the dashboard <b>is</b> running, and you have <b>never</b> been able to
 view a script/form/chart/report, it may be that you need to adjust your proxy
 settings.  Many people work at companies where they do not have a direct
 connection to the internet, but instead must connect to the web via an HTTP
 proxy server. If this describes you, you may need to tell your browser to
 bypass the proxy for the address "localhost". The instructions below may not
 apply to your browser word-for-word, but should hopefully get you pointed in
 the right direction:
  <UL>
   <LI>For Internet Explorer, choose &quot;Tools <img src="Images/rarrow.png"> Internet Options&quot;. Click on
      the &quot;Connections&quot; tab, then on the &quot;LAN
      Settings&quot; button. Make certain the &quot;Bypass proxy
      server for local addresses&quot; box is
      <b><strong>checked</strong></b>.</li>
   <LI>For Netscape, choose &quot;Edit <img src="Images/rarrow.png">
      Preferences&quot;. Under the Category &quot;Advanced <img src="Images/rarrow.png"> Proxies&quot;, click the
      &quot;Manual proxy configuration&quot; button, and ensure that
      the &quot;No Proxy for&quot; box contains
      &quot;localhost&quot;.</LI>
  </UL>

<p><hr><a name="doc50_BrokenForms"></a><b>My web browser is able to show the forms, 
but none of the entry blanks have any information.  What is wrong?</b>

<p>The dashboard uses web browsers in unique and innovative
ways. Unfortunately, some browsers aren't up to the task. If you can
see the HTML forms but they don't seem to be talking to the Dashboard,
then it is likely that your browser (or the Java environment within
your browser) is encountering problems.</p>

<p>Your first step should be to ensure that you are using one of the
browsers recommended for use with the dashboard. (See the
<a href="#doc13_top">installation help topic</a> for
more information.)</p>

<p>If you are using one of the approved browsers and you still have
this problem, please send us an email at
<u>processdash-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</u> and we will attempt to 
help you with the problem.</p>

<P><hr><A NAME="doc50_ChooseJVM"></A><b>I have several versions of the Java Runtime
Environment on my computer. How can I tell the dashboard which one to use?</b>

<P>(These instructions apply to Windows.)&nbsp;
<ol>
  <li>Right-click on the icon you use to run the dashboard, and choose
    Properties</li>
  <li>The &quot;Target&quot; field will contain &quot;C:\Program Files\Process
    Dashboard\pspdash.jar&quot;. Change it to read (all on one line):<br><br>
      <code><FONT SIZE="-2">&quot;C:\Program&nbsp;Files\JavaSoft\JRE\1.3.1\bin\java&quot; -jar &quot;C:\Program&nbsp;Files\Process&nbsp;Dashboard\pspdash.jar&quot;</font></code><br><br>
    (Of course, you may need to modify the path to the &quot;java&quot; program
    if it is slightly different on your computer.)
     </li>
</ol>

<P><hr><A NAME="doc50_TwoForms"></A><b>If I have a dashboard script or form open,
and I click the script button to open another form, the new form appears in
my existing browser window, replacing the old form. Why can't I have two
forms open at once?</b>

<P>You can have as many scripts and forms open as you like! The behavior
you are seeing is a Microsoft "feature" designed to reduce clutter on your
screen. Fortunately, you can alter that behavior. The instructions below
may not apply to your browser word-for-word, but should hopefully get you
pointed in the right direction:

<OL>
  <LI>In Internet Explorer, choose "Tools <img src="Images/rarrow.png"> Internet Options".</LI>
  <LI>Click the "Advanced" tab.</LI>
  <LI>Remove the checkmark next to the option, "Reuse windows for
      launching shortcuts."</LI>
</OL>

<P><HR><a name="doc50_NoConnection"></a><B>All my data elements say "NO 
CONNECTION".  What is wrong?</B>

<P>The forms always display "live" data - this allows them to auto-recalculate
numbers (like a spreadsheet does) when you edit data.  It also allows changes
made in one browser window to appear immediately in other browser windows. To
make all this happen, the browser maintains an open connection to the
dashboard, and passes data back and forth across this connection.</P>

<P>If you are viewing a form, and you close the main dashboard window, this
open connection is closed as well.  When this occurs, the form immediately
displays "NO CONNECTION" to let you know that your changes are no longer making
it back to the dashboard's data repository. To fix the problem, you must
<OL>
 <LI>restart the dashboard</li>
 <LI>click the refresh/reload button on your browser.</li>
</OL>

<P>If the dashboard <em>is running</em> and you are still getting "NO 
CONNECTION" in the data elements, it could be that the data port that the 
dashboard is trying to use is already taken on your machine.  Normally the 
dashboard will search for an open port to establish the connection, making 
this kind of problem unlikely.  However, if you have overridden this behavior 
in the configuration file the dashboard will not search for a port and may be 
experiencing a conflict with some other process on your machine.  To fix this 
problem, you must</p>
<OL>
 <LI>stop the dashboard</li>
 <LI>remove the following line from your configuration file:
  <pre>
   http.port=&lt;some port number&gt;
  </pre>
 </li>
 <li>restart the dashboard</li>
</ol>

<P>This will allow the dashboard to search for an available communications 
port.</p>

<P><HR><a name="doc50_ERROR"></a><B>Some of my data elements say
"<code>#VALUE!</code>" or "<code>#DIV/0!</code>". What is wrong?</B>

<P>"<code>#VALUE!</code>" indicates that the dashboard cannot calculate a 
value because the formula references a value that is missing (displayed as 
"<CODE>?????</CODE>") or otherwise invalid (for example, a value like 
"<CODE>foo</CODE>" when a number was expected).  When you see 
"<code>#VALUE!</code>" in a dashboard form, it almost <I>always</I> means 
that there is a "<code>?????</code>" field somewhere that you still need to 
fill in. If you fill in all the "<code>?????</code>" fields and the 
"<code>#VALUE!</code>" field does not recalculate, check to ensure that the 
calculation is not <A HREF="#doc36_top">frozen</A>.</P>

<P>"<code>#DIV/0!</code>" indicates that the dashboard encounted a 
divide-by-zero error when calculating a particular data value. Many times 
this is due to having a very small number of usable data points recorded by 
the dashboard.  For instance, if you start the dashboard for the first time 
and try to look at Process Summary forms for a PSP2.1 process, the "% To 
Date" fields will be filled with "<code>#DIV/0!</code>".  This is because the 
total amount of time recorded in the tool is 0.  The percentage calculation 
attempts to divide by zero and returns the error.</P>

<P>Another problem can contribute to this condition as well.  If you are not 
in the habit of clicking the little "completion" checkbox at the right end of 
the dashboard, some (or all) of your data will be ignored by the dashboard 
when creating reports and graphs.  The reporting features of the dashboard 
only report tasks/projects that are marked as complete.  See the <a href="#doc41_top">Using the Completion Checkbox</a>
help topic for more information.</P>

<P><HR><a name="doc50_BadExcel"></a><B>I tried to export my data to Excel with the 
link on one of the forms, but I just got a small ASCII file.  What is 
wrong?</B>

<P>For the "Export to Excel" functionality to work seamlessly, you must have 
the ".IQY" file type properly set up on your system.  This setup is normally 
performed by Microsoft Office during the installation process for Excel
(although, notably, certain releases of Office 97 do not perform this
setup).</p>

<P>If the IQY file type is not properly set up, clicking the "Export to 
Excel" links may instead cause Notepad to appear with a short, three-line 
text file. Alternatively, that three line text file might appear in an Excel 
spreadsheet.</p>

<P>If you encounter such problems, the simplest fix is to add the
following line to your <a href="#doc52_top">configuration file</a>:</p>

<pre> excel.exportMethod=mime</pre>

<p>And data will be exported to Excel <A HREF="#doc49_static">statically</A>.</P>

<P><HR><a name="doc50_NoSubmit"></A><B>Why is there no "submit" button on the HTML 
forms?</B>

<P>The HTML forms used by the dashboard are continually "live".  There is no 
need to press a submit button to send your data to the dashboard.  Simply 
enter your data where necessary, and the dashboard will record it.  However,
after editing a data field, it is usually necessary to leave that field for
your changes to take effect.  You can press the TAB button or click somewhere
else on the page. If the data you are changing is related to other data items 
on the page, you should see the other data elements update. For more
information, see the <A HREF="#doc27_top">Entering process 
data</A> help topic.</P>


<P><HR><a name="doc50_TimerUpdate"></a><B>I've started the timer, but none of the 
numbers on my reports are changing.  How can I know that it is working?</b>

<p>When the timer is running and you first navigate to an activity, the
dashboard will not create an entry in the time log until you have spent a full
minute there; this is by design.  For a more detailed explanation, see the
help topic for the <a href="#doc40_timelogdelay">play /
pause button</a>.</P>

<P>Also, the dashboard will make a quiet "tick" sound whenever the timer 
starts and when a new project or project phase is chosen by the hierarchy 
menus when the timer is running. If you do not hear this sound, check the 
state of the play/pause button.  The current state of the timer can always be 
determined by positioning the mouse pointer over the play/pause button.  A 
tooltip help will pop up containing the current state.</p>


<P><HR><a name="doc50_FrozenData"></a><B>I made a mistake in one of my numbers on 
the Project Plan Summary form, but the form won't let me change the numbers! 
What can I do?</b>

<P>The dashboard will "freeze" your planning data once you have completed the 
planning phase by clicking the completion checkbox.  Also it will freeze all 
the data when the project is marked as complete.  You can make these numbers 
editable by marking either the project or the planning phase incomplete 
again.  For more info on freezing data see the <a href="#doc36_top">data freezing</a> and the <a href="#doc41_top">completion checkbox</a> help 
topics.</p>


<P><HR><a name="doc50_FormsColors"></a><b>What is the significance of the different 
text colors on the PSP process scripts and forms?</b>

<P>In his book <I>A Discipline for Software Engineering</I> where he outlines 
the Personal Software Process, Watts Humphrey introduces the various process 
elements for doing PSP work in a graduated manner.  Each PSP process is built 
upon the previous one.  As a way of showing which process elements were added 
to the previous process definition, the forms in the book highlight the new 
process elements in <b><i>bold italics</i></b>.  These highlighted elements
return to normal text at the next process level. In our attempt to make our
online forms as identical to the PSP forms as possible, we have included that
detail.</P>

<P>However, the Process Dashboard makes certain steps on the scripts and forms
unnecessary (e.g. instructions to sum up various data items -- the dashboard
sums them for you).  These unnecessary process steps are displayed as
greyed-out text.</P>

<P>Also, there are places where the dashboard <i>slightly</i> changes the way
certain steps are performed (e.g.  instead of performing a PROBE calculation,
the PROBE tool should be used).  Green text is used to indicate this slight
departure from the <i>true</i> PSP scripts and forms.</P>

<P><HR><a name="doc50_PrototypicalData"></a><b>What is &quot;Prototypical PSP Data?&quot;  I'm seeing it in some of the charts and reports.</b>

<P>When you first begin using the dashboard, you have no historical
data.  As a result, previous versions of the dashboard would display
&quot;#DIV/0!&quot; in the &quot;Plan&quot; column of your first
project if it was based upon anything other than a PSP0 process.</P>

<P>Beginning with version 1.6.2, the dashboard will detect that you
have no historical data, and introduce an example dataset based upon
industry data and best practices.  The dashboard uses this dataset to
calculate the plan for your first PSP project.</P>

<P>As soon as you complete at least one PSP project, this example
dataset will disappear.  In the meantime, it may appear in various
dashboard charts and reports.</P>


<P><HR><a name="doc50_ExtDocFail"></a><b>I click on a document hyperlink in a 
process script, but the document never opens.</b>

<P>For maximum portability, the document templates provided with the 
dashboard are rich text files (.rtf). Some browsers (most notably Netscape on 
the Linux platform) don't know what to do with a rich text file, and so they 
prompt you to save it (not very helpful). To solve this problem, you must:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Obtain a program capable of editing rich text files, and install it
   on your machine. ("Open Office" is one possibility; it is free and runs 
   on Linux. Visit <u>http://www.openoffice.org/</u>)</LI>
  <LI>Configure your web browser, and tell it that files ending with ".rtf"

   program you just installed.</LI>
</OL>

<p><hr><a name="doc50_ProcessTweak"></a><b>I'd like to make a minor change to a process script someone else wrote.  Can I do that?</b>

<p>Yes you can!  Please see the section on <a href="#doc54_OverwritingScript">overwriting 
process scripts</a> in the help topic that describes how the dashboard finds 
the script files.</p>

<P><HR><a name="doc50_WhereIsConfig"></A><B>Where is the configuration file located?</B>

<P>The configuration file is named <code>.pspdash</code> on Unix systems and
<code>pspdash.ini</code> on Windows systems.  It can be located in either of
two places: the user's data directory or the user's home directory (on Unix 
systems).  The dashboard looks in the data directory first, then in the user's
home directory.  To find out exactly where your configuration file is located,
choose &quot;Help <img src="Images/rarrow.png"> About Process
Dashboard&quot; from the configuration menu, then click on the link for
"user settings". See the <a href="#doc52_top">configuration file</A> help
topic for more information about the configuration file and the settings that
can be defined there.</P>

<P><HR><a name="doc50_WhereData"></a><B>Where is my PSP data stored?</B>
<P>The dashboard stores all of your data in a single directory, in plain text
files.  This directory is often referred to in this documentation as the "data
directory".  With the current default configuration, data is always stored in
the "current working directory" when the dashboard is run.</P>

<P>On Windows systems, the "current working directory" is set by the icon you
use to run the dashboard.  If you right-click on that icon and choose
"Properties", there will be a text field labelled "Start in:" which identifies
your data directory.  Altering this value will change the location where the
dashboard looks for your data.  It is possible to have multiple, independent
data directories all on the same machine; just make copies of the icon you use
to start the dashboard, and give each icon a different value for the "Start in"
directory.</P>

<P>You can find out the exact location of your data directory by
choosing &quot;Help <img src="Images/rarrow.png"> About Process
Dashboard&quot; from the configuration menu, then clicking on the link
for &quot;user settings&quot;.</p>


<P><HR><a name="doc50_MoveData"></A><B>How can I backup my psp data and/or move it

<P>If you want to backup your psp data, simply back up the contents of your

computer,</p>

<UL>
<LI>stop the dashboard if it is running</LI>
<LI>copy the contents of your data directory to a directory on the new

<LI>run the dashboard on the new computer, using the chosen directory as the
    data directory.</LI></UL>


<p><hr><a name="doc50_CorruptFiles"></a><b>I got a warning box that claims that my data files have been corrupted!  Can I get my data back?</b>

<p>If you did not continue running the dashboard when the dialog warned you 
that doing so could be quite dangerous, then yes, you probably can.</p>

<p>If you see this message, realize that the dashboard is being overly cautious
with your data.  As long as you didn't plow on ahead and run the dashboard 
with the questionable files in place, no data has been lost yet.  The best 
steps to take next are:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Examine the corrupt files mentioned in the warning message.  If they are 
   of zero length, then there is most likely nothing to worry about. Just 
   delete the zero length files and restart the dashboard.</li>
 <li>If the files contain something, examine their contents.  Removing the 
   "tttt" at the beginning of the filename should indicate what <em>real</em>
   file was being created at the time the problem was detected. See if the 
   temporary files contain any data that is missing from the original file, 
   and copy it over if necessary.  Finally, delete the temporary files and 
   restart the dashboard.</li>
</ol>

<p>Even though the Dashboard has been designed to be safe with your precious 
process data, it is still a good idea to back up the Dashboard's data 
directory every so often.  See the question about <a href="#doc50_MoveData">backing 
up your Dashboard data</a> for more information.</p>


<p><hr><a name="doc50_UnixClutteredHomeDir"></a><b>I'm on a Unix/Linux
system, and the dashboard is cluttering my home directory with lots of
files!  How do I fix this?</b></p>

<p>When you start the dashboard (whether on Linux, Windows, or any
other operating system), it uses the "current working directory" for
data storage.</p>

<p>On Windows, the installer program automatically creates a shortcut
for the user which launches the dashboard with the appropriate current
working directory, as selected during the installation process.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the installer is not able to create shortcuts on the
Linux platform yet, so it's up to you to create an appropriate
launcher manually. The dashboard does its best to help you out, by
creating a shell script in your chosen data directory called
"<tt>run-dash.sh</tt>". Take a look at the contents of that shell
script. Embedded comments in that file include some helpful
information; for example, If java and/or netscape are not in your
path, you may need to edit a particular line of the script. With those
edits, you should be able to use the script to launch the
dashboard.</p>

<p>If you have already started using the dashboard and you've already
created projects in your hierarchy that you want to keep, you can move
them by carefully following the steps below:
<ul>
  <li><b>Shut down the dashboard if it is running. Do not skip this
      step!</b></li>

  <li>Find files in your home directory matching any of the following
      patterns, and move them into your chosen data directory:

<pre>    global.dat       state
    time.log         .pspdash
    timelog.xml      ###.dat
    timelog2.xml     ###.def</pre></li>

  <li>Edit the <tt>run-dash.sh</tt> file in your data directory as
      necessary.  Then create a launcher for <tt>run-dash.sh</tt>
      within your desktop environment (e.g. Gnome / KDE).</li>

</ul></p>


<p><hr><a name="doc50_HideFinished"></a><b>Can I hide my finished projects from the 
hierarchy browser (and other screens)?  They are starting to pile up and are 
taking up a lot of space.</b>

<p>Unfortunately, No.  We have this as a feature request.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the Cut and Paste features in the hierarchy browser will 
allow you to move your completed projects away from the part of the hierarchy 
where you are doing your active development.  You could create a node at the 
top of the project hierarchy called "Archived Projects" and Cut and Paste 
your finished projects as children under it.  They would still count towards 
your PROBE Estimates and your Planning data.  See the <a href="#doc28_top">hierarchy editor</a> help topic
for more information.</p>


<p><hr><a name="doc50_OutlierProject"></a><b>I have a project in my hierarchy that 
doesn't have much to do with my current development habits.  Can I mark it as 
an "outlier" so that it doesn't corrupt the Planning and PROBE estimates?</b>

<p>There are basically two concerns when in this kind of situation.</p>
<ol>
 <li>Removing the project from PROBE Estimates</li>
 <li>Removing the project from Planning and To Date calculations</li>
</ol>

<p>The most important time to identify a project as an outlier is during 
PROBE-style linear regression.  This is easy to do; when using the PROBE 
tool, you can click on the "Chart" button to visually identify outliers, 
and the "Filter" button to remove any outliers from the regression 
calculation.  The PROBE Wizard will also let you remove various data pairings 
from the regression calculation, but it won't show you a graph and thus isn't 
as intuitive.  See the <a href="#doc31_top">PROBE 
Tool</a> and <a href="#doc30_top">PROBE Wizard</a>
help topics for more information.</p>

<p>To remove a project's effects from Planning and To Date calculations, you 
can make use of multiple data sets.  By defining a customized data set for 
your current project, you can isolate only the data you know is applicable.  
See the <a href="#doc53_top">multiple To Date 
data</a> help topic for more information.</p>

<p>A less desireable but simpler way to remove a project's effects would be 
to mark the project as incomplete.  The To Date, Planning, and PROBE 
calculations only use completed projects for their data sets.  The drawback 
with this approach is that you will lose the accurate completion date for the 
project that you mark incomplete.</p>

<P><HR><a name="doc50_WebServerWorms"></a><b>Since the dashboard has a web server in it, do I have to worry about internet worms and viruses attacking my machine?</b>

<P>A good question! The short answer: the web server built into the
dashboard is NOT susceptible to any existing worms or viruses, and the
default dashboard settings make it impossible for other computers to
connect to your dashboard.</P>

<P>The longer answer: the web server in the dashboard is custom code,
written from scratch specifically for the dashboard. Because it shares
no common code with any other web server, viruses and worms which have
been written to attack other web servers (such as Microsoft's IIS web
server) will not affect it in any way.</P>

<P>We cannot guarantee that the dashboard web-server code is
defect-free, and impervious to attacks by hackers. But those hackers
would have to write a virus or worm to specifically target the
dashboard. The dashboard currently has less than 10000 users
worldwide, so I would imagine it to be a fairly unlikely target.</P>

<P>Fortunately, because the dashboard is written in Java rather than
C/C++, it is not susceptible to many common hacking techniques like
buffer overruns (a common worm infection strategy). This means that
even if a hacker was interested in writing an attack targeted at the
dashboard, the worst thing they could probably do is to crash your
running dashboard program.</P>

<P>If this information doesn't allay your concerns, you can use the
"http.allowRemote" setting to ensure that it is impossible for other 
computers to connect to the dashboard (this is the default). See the 
<a href="#doc52_http.allowRemote">configuration
file</a> help topic for more information.</P>


<P><HR><a name="doc50_DCRSCR"></a><b>What happened to the DCR and SCR processes?</b>

<P>The DCR and SCR processes were shipped with version 1.1 of the
Process Dashboard.  They were later removed from the main dashboard
and distributed as add-on process sets.  As of version 1.4.1, they are
no longer available.</P>

<P>Explicit written permission from Addison-Wesley is required to modify
PSP scripts or distribute modified PSP scripts.  Since the DCR/SCR process
scripts were derived from the copyrighted PSP process scripts in <i>A
Discipline for Software Engineering</i>, they fall into this category.
We have not attempted to obtain that permission from Addison-Wesley, so
these processes are no longer available.</p>

<P><HR><a name="doc50_Auto"></a><B>I would like to integrate the dashboard more 
closely with my IDE. Is it possible to programatically start/stop the timer, 
and change the active hierarchy path?</B>

<P>Yes! If you issue an HTTP request of the form:

<PRE><FONT SIZE="-2">http://localhost:2468/control/startTiming.class</FONT></PRE>

the dashboard timer will start.  Similarly, an HTTP request of the form:

<PRE><FONT SIZE="-2">http://localhost:2468/control/stopTiming.class</FONT></PRE>

will pause the timer. And

<PRE><FONT SIZE="-2">http://localhost:2468/Non+Project/foo//control/setPath.class</FONT></PRE>

will change the current hierarchy path to "/Non Project/foo". If you want
to change the current hierarchy path <b>and</b> start the timer, use

<PRE><FONT SIZE="-2">...//control/setPath.class<B>?start</B></FONT></PRE>

<B>Note</B>: these commands will have no effect unless the HTTP

 <li><strong>ev.sortCompletedTasks</strong><br>

    As you complete tasks in an earned value schedule, the dashboard will use
    that information to improve the quality of the planned completion dates
    for the remaining tasks.  It does this by internally reordering the list
    of tasks so completed tasks appear at the beginning of the task list, in
    the order they were actually completed.  To disable this behavior, and
    calculate planned completion dates based on explicit task order alone, set
    this to false.<br>

   The method to use for exporting data into Excel. If this is set to "mime", 
   data will be exported to Excel using mime types; in practical terms, this
   means that the data you see in Excel will be a snapshot.  If this is set to
   "iqy", tables will be exported using a Microsoft Internet Web Query (.IQY) 
   file; in practical terms, this means that Excel can dynamically requery
   the dashboard to get updated data.<br>

   times are displayed in hours:minutes (for example, "1:30" for one hour
   and thirty minutes).  This is a change from earlier versions of the
   dashboard, which displayed times as a number of minutes (for example, 
   "90").  This setting makes it possible to revert back to the prior
   formatting.<br>

   If false, the dashboard will reject all HTTP connections unless they come 
   from "localhost".<br>
   Note that password settings (such as those set on shared/published
   earned value schedules) establish exceptions that override this setting.
   Thus, if you have set this to true, setting a password will deny 
   connection attempts that do not correctly identify the password.
   Conversely, you can leave this set to false, and setting a password
   will allow connection attempts that correctly supply the password.<br>
   If you <i>never</i> want other people to be able to connect to your
   dashboard (whether they know a password or not), set this parameter
   to <code>"never"</code>. This will make it impossible for other
   computers to see your dashboard.<br>

 <li><strong>http.hostname</strong><br>
   Most of the time, you interact with the dashboard web server by viewing
   a web page that begins with "http://localhost".  This works fine when
   the dashboard and the web browser are both running on the same computer.
   Sometimes, though, it is desirable to construct a URL for other people
   to use (for example, when publishing or sharing an earned value schedule).
   The dashboard will ascertain the name of your computer and use that to
   construct the URL; this process should work 99% of the time. If, however,
   the dashboard deduces an incorrect name for your computer, you can use
   this setting to override the built-in name deduction logic.<br>

<P>By default, the dashboard maintains one set of To Date data, which rolls 
up data from all of your completed PSP projects. This may not meet your data 
needs. For example, if you continually work in several different programming 
languages, you might want multiple, independent sets of To Date data, one 
for each programming language.  "Data Rollup Templates" address this need.</P>

<p>Data Rollup Templates allow filtering of the data that appears on process 
forms such as the Project Plan Summary.  Once you have created a data rollup 
in your hierarchy, you can choose to view the forms based on all of your PSP 
related data or just on the subset that you have defined.  The Data Rollup 
Templates can also be used to rollup data from many small PSP-sized tasks up 
to the project level. It's just a matter of how you define the data rollup 
filter expression.</P>

<H3><a name="para_6_2_1_"></a>6.2.1. Creating Multiple "To Date" Data Sets</H3>

<p>Extra To Date data sets are created in much the same way you would 
create a new project.  You just create the data set in the hierarchy as if 
you are adding a Project Template.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/HierarchyEditorRollup.png"></center></p>

<p>You can rename the data set node just like you can a project.  Also, the 
location of the data set itself in the hierarchy is not important.  Just 
place it wherever it seems to fit best to you.  For more information on 
adding nodes and templates and on using the hierarchy editor in general, see 
the <a href="#doc28_top">hierarchy editor</a> help 
topic.</p>

<p>Note - there is always a default rollup, defined automatically by the 
dashboard, which is called "/To Date/PSP/All".  This rollup will not appear 
in your hierarchy, but its data is available for use by projects in your 
hierarchy.</p>

<a name="doc53_filter"></a><H3><a name="para_6_2_2_"></a>6.2.2. Customizing "To Date" Data Sets</H3>

<p>When you first create a new To Date data set, it will (by default) be 
rolling up data from all completed PSP projects.  Therefore, the first thing 
you'll probably want to do is customize the filter which is used to generate 
the list of projects that it will roll up data from.  This is done via data 
entered in an HTML form, much like the standard process forms.</p>

<p>To access the filtering form, use the hierarchy menus to navigate to the 
To Date data set you have just created.  Once there, click the drop-down 
button on the script button and choose "Edit Data Rollup Filter."</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/ChooseEditDataRollupFilter.png"></center></p>

<p>The filter form will appear that will let you edit the expression that is 
used to filter the project list that is used in the data rollup.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/DataRollupFilterForm.png"></center></p>

<p>Some common filtering criteria are displayed as choices on the form:
<ul>
 <li>Only rollup projects completed after a certain date</li>
 <li>Only rollup projects written with a certain language</li>
 <li>Only rollup projects with certain keywords</li>
 <li>Only rollup projects whose hierarchy path starts with a certain 
   string</li>
</ul>

<p>You can check the appropriate boxes, and edit the details for each 
criteria.  When you're done, click the "Filter!" button. This button will 
compute the corresponding filter expression, and put it in the box below.  
This will also cause the "list of included projects" to recalculate, showing 
you all the projects in your hierarchy that meet the criteria.</p>

<p>If you feel comfortable with the data expression syntax, you can edit the 
filter expression directly.  After you make changes to the expression, you'll 
have to move the cursor out of the text area (by hitting TAB or by clicking 
somewhere on the HTML page background) for the included project list to 
recalculate.</p>

<p><B>TIP:</B> If the included project list is empty and you don't think it 
should be, you may have a syntax error in your filter expression.  A syntax 
error in your expression will essentially be treated the same as the 
expression "false".  Note, however, that an empty included project list does 
not automatically mean your filter expression syntax is bad - it may be a 
valid expression, and there just might not be any projects that meet the 
criteria.</p>

<H3><a name="para_6_2_3_"></a>6.2.3. Viewing Rolled Up Data</H3>

<P>To view rolled up data, just use the hierarchy menus to navigate to a data 
rollup node, and click the script button. The <A HREF="#doc48_charts">Data 
Analysis</A> center will appear - but it will be displaying only data from 
the projects that you have included in your rollup!  In fact, the main "Data 
Analysis" center which is launched from the Configure menu is nothing more 
than a view of the rolled up data for the automatic data rollup called "/To 
Date/PSP/All".</P>

<H3><a name="para_6_2_4_"></a>6.2.4. Using Alternate "To Date" Data Sets</H3>

<p>Once you have created an additional data rollup set, you will notice that 
all of your PSP Project Plan Summaries will contain an extra drop-down list.  
This drop down list is located in the "Project Settings" section of the plan 
summary form.  The drop-down list is labeled "Base 'To Date' PSP data on:", 
and the drop down list will contain all the PSP data rollup objects you have 
defined, plus the extra "default" rollup, which is called "/To 
Date/PSP/All".  Choosing a different rollup from this list will cause this 
project to use that rollup as the basis for data in the "Plan" and "To Date"
columns.</p>

<p><center><img src="Images/DataRollupSummaryPullDown.png"></center></p>

<p><B>TIP:</B> remember that data in the plan column <A HREF="#doc36_top">freezes</A> when planning is marked 
complete, and data in the "To Date" columns freezes when the project is 
marked complete.  Therefore, if Planning and/or the entire project is marked 
complete when you alter the drop-down, the data in the "Plan" and/or "To 
Date" columns will not recalculate.</p>

<a name="doc54_OverwritingScript"></a><h2><a name="para_6_3_"></a>6.3. Making a change to a script</h2>

<p>Perhaps a pre-existing process suits you well, but you'd like to make 
some small tweak to one of the HTML scripts.  For example, you might like to 
add company specific instructions to some of the steps (to run a code 
analyzer perhaps).</p>

<p>When you're viewing the page in question, you notice it has a URL like:</p>

<p><code>http://localhost:2468/Project+Path//<b>procID/script.htm</b></code></p>

<p>In this example, "procID" is the ID of the process containing the script, 
and "script.htm" is the name of an HTML script within that process.</p>

<p>Take the following steps:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Find your pspdash.jar file (if you are running on Windows, it should be 
   specified in the shortcut that launches the dashboard -- if you are 
   running on Unix, you should know where the pspdash.jar is located based on 
   where you installed the dashboard!).</li>
 <li>Create a directory alongside it called "Templates".</li>
 <li>Create a subdirectory within "Templates" with the name that appears
   in the "procID" space in the example above.</li>
 <li>Save the current version of the HTML file to the subdirectory you
   just created. This can be done by choosing &quot;File
   <img src="Images/rarrow.png">
   Save As...&quot; from within your web browser. <ul>
   <li>Give the file the same name that appears in the URL - in this
      instance, we would save the file as "script.htm".  (Note: if the
      URL contains a "?" or "#", just use the filename that appears
      before the "?" or "#".)
   <li>If your web browser has a feature to save "html only", use it.</li>
   </ul>

</li>
 <li>Edit it to your heart's content using the HTML editor of your choice.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, every time you visit that page, for any project in your
hierarchy that uses this process, the dashboard will show you the page
containing your custom changes.</p>

<a name="doc54_FindFiles"></a><H2><a name="para_6_4_"></a>6.4. How the Dashboard finds process files</H2>

<p>When it starts, the dashboard searches for process files and add-ins and 
dynamically loads them.  Also, every time you request a web page from 
<code>http://localhost:2468/</code>, the dashboard is using this same search 
mechanism.</p>

<p>The dashboard searches for files in the following locations, in the 
following order:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Look first in the directory specified by the user setting 
   "templates.directory" (should end in "Templates").</li>

 <li>Next, look in any JAR files contained in that directory.</li>

 <li>Next, look in any JAR files contained in the parent of that 
   directory.</li>

 <li>If there is a Templates directory alongside the pspdash.jar file, look 
   there, first for the file, then for JARs containing the file.</li>

 <li>If there are any JAR files next to the pspdash.jar file, look in 
   them.</li>

 <li>Finally, look in the classpath (which includes the pspdash.jar file, and 
   contains all the built-in processes).</li>
</ol>

<p>When looking for a particular file, the dashboard will search in the above 
locations and stop as soon as it finds a matching file. This means that if 
you want to customize anything that appears in a process templates directory, 
you can.  Just create your custom version and put it in a location earlier on 
the search list.</p>

<a name="doc54_sharing"></a><h3><a name="para_6_4_1_"></a>6.4.1. Sharing changes with team members</h3>

<p>If you're working with a team, and everyone on your team would like access 
to changes you have made to a process script, you can do the following:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Create a directory somewhere out on a shared network drive, called 
   "Templates" (for example: "<code>T:\Common\Our Team 
   Folder\Templates</code>" on a Windows network, or 
   "<code>/usr/shared/OurTeam/Templates</code>" on a Unix network)</li>
 <li>Have each person on your team edit their configuration file, and add a 
   line for the "templates.directory" setting. (for example: 
   "<code>templates.directory=T:\\Common\\Our Team Folder\\Templates</code>"
   - the double backslashes are required on Windows systems; Unix systems can 
   just use single forward slashes).</li>
 <li>Put custom versions of files underneath this team templates directory.  
   For example, you could put:
  <ul>
   <li>HTML files overriding files that are built into the dashboard</li>
   <li>LanguageFilters defining custom LOC counters</li>
   <li><a href="#doc55_XmlDef">template.xml</a> files 
      defining team processes</li>
   <li>Data files and HTML scripts/forms supporting those team <a href="#doc55_top">processes</a></li>
  </ul>
   and when you make changes to these items, everyone on the team will see 
   them automatically (except as noted below).</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="para_6_4_2_"></a>6.4.2. Some files are only read at start up</h3>

<p>When you change HTML files, everyone will see your changes immediately.  
The very next time they view the HTML page in question, they will see your 
changes.  Other files, however, the dashboard will only read once.  For 
example, template.xml files, datafiles, and LOC counters will only be read 
once, when the dashboard starts up.  If you make changes to these files, 
people will have to shut down and restart their dashboard to see your 
changes.</p>

<!-- How to define your own custom process
   * An overview of the process definition architecture: explain the three
     pieces to the puzzle and how they fit together:
      * "-template.xml" files define the *structure* of the process
      * optional HTML files provide process scripts and forms
      * optional data files define custom calculations for your process
     Also explain how the dashboard locates these files (i.e., where should
     you put these files, and how can you share them with your co-workers) -->


<P>The dashboard has been designed from the ground up to support custom 
processes.  The PSP scripts and forms that you see are not hard-coded into 
the tool. Instead, they are dynamically loaded from simple HTML and text 
files.  Thus, it is possible to create your own custom process scripts, 
forms, and data that will be dynamically integrated into the dashboard.</P>

<P>The dashboard process definition framework provides a great deal of 
flexibility and power for process automation. The more advanced features will 
be documented in a <I>Process Authoring Manual</I>, which will be available 
for download from <U>http://processdash.sourceforge.net/</U> soon. However, 
creating a simple, custom process is not difficult. Just follow these 
steps:</P>

</OL>

<H3><a name="para_6_5_1_"></a>6.5.1. <A NAME="doc55_ProcessStructure">Step 1: Identify your process structure</A></H3>

<P>What steps do you want to include in your process? The standard PSP0 
process, of course, includes the phases Planning, Design, Code, Compile, 
Test, and Postmortem. Think through your process and decide upon the list of 
phases that your process will include.</P>

<P>Think this through carefully. Remember how you had to restart your "To 
Date" data when you graduated from PSP1.1 to PSP2? The same truth applies 
here. Once you have defined a custom process and used it in the dashboard, 
even slight changes to the process definition will invalidate all your 
historical data. In fact, once you create a process definition and use it to 
perform a project, you can no longer even change the names of the phases 
without losing historical data.</P>

<P>If your process definition is still immature and evolving, it is probably 
better to use the <A HREF="#doc2_generic">Generic process</A> for a 
while. As you begin creating your own custom process definitions, the 
flexibility of the generic process will allow you to radically change your 
process from one task to the next in response to process improvement 
proposals.  Once you decide upon and finalize the <u>list of phases</u> in 
your process, you are ready to begin using a custom process.</P>

<P>Some guidelines to consider as you identify your process phases:</P>

<P><B>Don't subdivide things too far.</B> Take a look at the PSP processes, 
for example. They will define a single phase like Planning, even though it 
contains several different steps (obtain requirements, make size estimate, 
make resource estimate, create schedule, etc.). The PSP process definition 
does not break each of these steps into its own phase! Herein lies the 
difference between a <B>phase</B> and an <B>activity</B>. By carefully 
defining the high level phases in the process, Watts Humphrey was free to 
incorporate process improvements simply by altering the set of activities in 
each phase. Remember also that when you enact your process, you will have to 
collect time and defect data with phase-level granularity. If you break your 
process up into a zillion tasks that each take only a minute, you will go 
crazy just trying to log time accurately. Therefore, if your custom process
contains more than a dozen phases, it's most likely subdivided too far.</P>

<P>Here's another way to think about this: the dashboard is a useful tool
because it seamlessly integrates your <b>process script</b> and your <b>metrics
collection framework</b>. By tying the two things together, you have all the
tools you need at your fingertips to enact the process. But as a result, this
means that when you create a custom dashboard process, you must understand and
think about your custom process from both perspectives. Many people are able to
easily think up a script for their process, but you must <u>also</u> take time
to think about your metrics collection framework. The phases you choose in your
custom process define the "buckets" in your metrics collection
framework. If you choose these phases thoughtfully, it will allow room for your
process to grow and improve. On the other hand, if you choose phases that
correspond one-to-one with activities in your process, you may find that your
custom process quickly becomes obsolete.</P>

<P><B>Choose abbreviations for long phase names.</B> When you write your 
process script, you may have phases with verbose names like "High Level 
Design Review". Realize that if you use this long phase name, the main 
dashboard window is going to stretch halfway across your screen whenever you 
navigate to that phase. An abbreviation like "HLD Review" may be more 
appropriate. You can still refer to the phase by its unabbreviated name when 
you create your HTML process scripts and forms.</P>

<P><B>Include Planning and Postmortem phases.</B> In his book, Watts Humphrey
encourages you to always include these phases in any process you define.  The 
planning phase serves an obvious purpose of estimating size, cost, schedule, 
risk, etc. The postmortem phase allows you to ensure accurate collection of 
data and capture process improvement proposals.</P>

<H3><a name="para_6_5_2_"></a>6.5.2. <A NAME="doc55_XmlDef">Step 2: Create an XML definition for your process</A></H3>

<P>The dashboard understands a process structure that is described in XML 
format. <B>The discussion below assumes that you are familiar with XML.</B>
If this is not the case, please go read a nice tutorial on XML before 
proceeding!!</P>

<P>Here is an example of an XML description file for a PSP0 process:</P>
<TABLE BORDER="1" WIDTH="100%">
 <TR>
  <TD WIDTH="100%">
   <PRE>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">&lt;?xml version='1.0'?&gt;

&lt;dashboard-process-template&gt;</FONT>

      &lt;phase name="Design"     type="dld"/&gt;
      &lt;phase name="Code"       type="code"/&gt;
      &lt;phase name="Compile"    type="comp"/&gt;
      &lt;phase name="Test"       type="ut"/&gt;
      &lt;phase name="Postmortem" type="pm"/&gt;
   &lt;/template&gt;
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">&lt;/dashboard-process-template&gt;</FONT>
   </PRE>
  </TD>
 </TR>
</TABLE>

<P>The file begins and ends with the header and footer (which appear in blue 
above). Between the header and footer, any number of process templates can be 
defined. (The file above only defines one process template.)</P>

<P>A process definition begins with the <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> tag and 
ends with <code>&lt;/template&gt;</code>. The template tag must have a 
"<code>name</code>" attribute, and all of the processes you define must have 
<B>unique</B> names. Also, template names cannot contain the "/" character. 
If you will be collecting defects with your process, you should include the 
"<CODE>defectLog</CODE>" attribute as shown above (and remember that XML is 
case-sensitive, so "<CODE>defect<U><B>l</B></U>og</CODE>" will not work).</P>

<P>Between the <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> tags, list the phases in order. 
Each phase is described with a <code>&lt;phase&gt;</code> tag. The phase tag 
must have a "<code>name</code>" attribute, and all of the phase names must be 
<B>unique</B>. As was true of template names, phase names cannot contain the 
"/" character. The phase type can optionally be specified with the 
"<CODE>type</CODE>" attribute. The following is a list of valid types that 
can be specified.  Their full explanation is not detailed here, but will be 
in the <I>Process Authoring Manual</I> coming soon on our website.</p>


<UL>
 <LI><B>Appraisal phase types:</B> <tt>appraisal reqinsp hldr hldrinsp dldr

 <LI><B>Development phase types:</B> <tt>req stp itp td hld dld code
   doc</tt></LI>
</UL>

<P>Phase types are not required. Even if you specify the phase type for one 
phase, you can omit it for others. If you do specify phase types, the 
dashboard will be able to intelligently calculate metrics like Yield, A/FR, 
and Defect removal efficiency.</P>

<H3><a name="para_6_5_3_"></a>6.5.3. <A NAME="doc55_XmlDesc">Step 3: Save your XML process descriptor</A></H3>

<P>Once your XML process descriptor is complete, it is time to save it 
somewhere <A HREF="#doc54_FindFiles">where the dashboard 
can find it</A>. Follow these steps:</P>

<ol>
 <li>Find your pspdash.jar file (on Windows machines, it is probably located 
   in <U>C:\Program Files\Process Dashboard</U>).</li>
 <li>Create a directory alongside it called "Templates" (e.g., <U>C:\Program 
   Files\Process Dashboard\Templates</U>).</li>
 <li>Save your XML process descriptor in that Templates directory. 
   <B>Important:</B> you must give your XML process descriptor a filename 
   ending with "<code><b>-template.xml</b></code>" to signal to the dashboard 
   that this is an XML process template descriptor.  If you do not choose a 
   filename ending with "<code><b>-template.xml</b></code>", your process 
   descriptor will be ignored.</li>
</ol>

<P>This is the simplest place to put your XML process descriptor. Of course, 
if you want to share your process with team members, you may want to put it 
somewhere else. See the section on <A HREF="#doc54_FindFiles">how the dashboard finds process 
files</A> for more information. Keep in mind that the dashboard will search 
for "<code><b>-template.xml</b></code>" files in the "Templates" directories 
only - subdirectories will not be searched.</P>

<H3><a name="para_6_5_4_"></a>6.5.4. <A NAME="doc55_Restart">Step 4: Restart the dashboard</A></H3>

<P>Once your XML process descriptor is in place, it is necessary to shut down 
the dashboard and restart it for the new process to be found.  Once found, 
you will automatically have:</P>

<UL>
 <LI>A template on the hierarchy editor's "Add Template" menu for your 
   process</LI>
 <LI>A template on the hierarchy editor's "Add Template" menu for <B>rolling 
   up</B> data from your process</LI>
 <LI>A custom project plan summary form for your process</LI>
</UL>

<h3><a name="para_6_5_5_"></a>6.5.5. Advanced/Optional: Defining HTML scripts</h3>

<P>Defining HTML scripts for your process and its phases is easy to
do. Here is an example of an XML description file for a PSP0 process,
with HTML script definitions added. The text in blue is identical to
the example shown in step 2 above; the black text illustrates the
additions:</P>

   &lt;/template&gt;
&lt;/dashboard-process-template&gt;</FONT>
   </PRE>
  </TD>
 </TR>
</TABLE>

<P>So right after your <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> tag, you list all
the HTML pages that you want to appear on the script button's drop
down menu, in order. (Note that you don't have to list every HTML page
used by your process - just the ones that you want to appear on the
script button menu.) For each HTML page, you state:</P>

<ul>

  <li>the title (which should usually match the
    <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> of the HTML page in question); this
    title will be displayed in the script button's drop-down menu</li>

  <li>the href to the page, relative to the "Templates" directory</li>

  <li>a unique ID for the HTML page (these only need to be unique
    within a given process <code>&lt;template&gt;</code>)</li>

</ul>

<p>Then you (optionally) associate these HTML pages with the phases by
adding an <code>htmlID</code> attribute which names the ID of the HTML
page associated with that phase. You can have HTML pages that aren't
associated with any phase, and vice versa. You can even associate an
HTML page with the <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> tag, as shown above;
then any phases which don't specify an <code>htmlID</code> of their
own will inherit that <code>htmlID</code>.</p>

<p>Of course, before the dashboard will be able to open any of these
HTML pages, you must actually create them and place them appropriately
underneath the "Templates" directory. You can use your favorite HTML
editor to create these pages; if you have a program like Microsoft
Word, it is capable of saving files in HTML format. Since the hrefs
are interpreted relative to the "Templates" directory, for this
example we would need to create a directory called "psp0" underneath
the "Templates" directory, and put files in that directory called
"script.html", "planning.html", "develop.html", and
"postmort.html".</p>

<p>The file "dash/summary.shtm" is special. It names an HTML file that
is shipped with the dashboard. When you don't name any HTML files for
your process, the dashboard assigns it "dash/summary.shtm" by default.
(This is why you could create an XML template file, specify no HTML
files, and still get a project plan summary form automatically.)
However, as soon as you include <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tags in your
template definition, the dashboard will no longer automatically assign
it "dash/summary.shtm", so you must manually include this entry to
ensure that you can view a plan summary form for your process.</p>

<H2><a name="para_6_6_"></a>6.6. Team Use</H2>

The process dashboard includes functionality which can be used by the
individuals on a software project team.</p>

<p>Different teams have different needs.  When using the dashboard to
plan and track your project, there are at least three different
approaches you could take.  These approaches (from simplest to more
advanced) are:

<ol>

<li><a href="#doc57_top">Rollup Earned Value Only</a></li>
<li><a href="#doc58_top">Rollup PSP Data and Earned Value</a></li>
<li><a href="#doc59_top">Rollup Custom Process Data and
    Earned Value</a></li>

</ol>

<!-- 

<p>The Process Dashboard maintains an internal repository of metrics data,
which is used to produce historical data views, "To Date" rollups, etc.
When you begin consolidating team data, it is a good idea to do this in a
new repository.  By creating a separate repository for team data, you avoid
the risk of accidentally including team metrics in the data analysis for a
particular individual.  You also avoid the risk of accidentally including
unrelated personal metrics in the team rollup.</p>

<p>The Process Dashboard reads and saves its metrics repository to files in
the "current working directory" when the dashboard is run.  Thus, to create
a new metrics repository, all you need to do is (a)&nbsp;create an empty
directory to hold the data, and (b)&nbsp;run the dashboard with that
directory as the "current working directory".  To reliably and repeatably
perform the second step, you'll probably want to create a new "shortcut" to
run the dashboard, which specifies the "current working directory"
appropriately.  (For more help and instructions for performing this step,
see the <a href="../Troubleshooting/FAQ.html#WhereData">Frequently Asked
Questions</a> help topic.</p>

-->


</div>
<div>

</div>
<a name="doc57_top"></a><div>


<H3><a name="para_6_6_1_"></a>6.6.1. Team Use - Earned Value Only</H3>

If your project team is small (only a few people), and you only need
to manage project cost and schedule, you can use the Earned Value
Collaboration Features that are built in to the dashboard to generate
a rolled-up earned value schedule.  This functionality is described in
the &quot;<a href="#doc35_top">Task
&amp; Schedule Collaboration</a>&quot; help topic.</p>

<p>The main advantage of this approach is that it is fairly simple to
use: graphical user interfaces are provided to walk you through the
steps involved in rolling up an earned value schedule.  This approach
works well for small teams, and is <b>very</b> useful for ad-hoc
planning (two or three individuals who wish to informally coordinate
their work).</p>

<p>The main disadvantage of this approach is that it uses peer-to-peer
network communication.  When you view the rolled up schedule, the
dashboard automatically retrieves up-to-date versions of each
sub-schedule.  If your project contains many people, this process may
take time.  In addition, if any team members are not running their
personal dashboard at the time, the rollup will be unable to retrieve
that person's sub-schedule, and will have to use a previously cached
version instead.  As a result, if you have many people on your project
team, or if the people on your project team do not typically leave the
Process Dashboard running, this approach may not be best for you;
consider using the <a href="#doc58_top">PSP/EV rollup
approach</a> instead.</p>

</div>
<div>

</div>
<a name="doc58_top"></a><div>


<H3><a name="para_6_6_2_"></a>6.6.2. Team Use - PSP Data and Earned Value</H3>

This approach can take your team a <u>long</u> way toward using
high-maturity techniques to track project progress. 

<p>To correctly use this technique, it is helpful to understand the
rollup process used by this approach.  In this approach, each team
member will run their own personal instance of the dashboard, which
they use to capture and track their own personal metrics.  In
addition, a team instance of the dashboard is run.  This team instance
aggregates team data, calculates rolled-up metrics, and displays
charts and reports of team project data.</p>


<p><center><img src="Images/TeamRollupDataFlow.png"></center></p>

<p>To simplify ongoing communication, this approach uses a shared
network directory (labeled &quot;Team Data Directory&quot; in the
diagram above).  Individuals configure their personal dashboard
instances to periodically export metrics data.  Each individual's data
is saved into a different file in this network folder.  Meanwhile, the
team dashboard instance is configured to import data from this same
directory.  The resulting imported data is then rolled up using
existing mechanisms already present in the Process Dashboard.</p>

<p>To use this approach, follow the steps below.</p>

<H4 NO_NUMBER>Create Team Data Directory</H4>

Most teams have a folder on a shared network drive where project
documents are stored.  Create a subdirectory specifically for
dashboard metrics data.  The main requirement is that all team members
should have the ability to save files to this directory.  In a Windows
environment, each team member will most likely want to map the network
drive so the folder is accessible via a simple filename.

<p>Depending on your organizational culture, you may also wish to
tighten permissions to prevent non-team members from viewing the
data.</p>

<H4 NO_NUMBER>Create Team Dashboard Instance</H4>

The word &quot;instance&quot; may be confusing to some.  By
&quot;instance,&quot; we mean a running dashboard program window, with
its own data storage area that differs from other
&quot;instances.&quot;

<p>You can run the Team Dashboard instance just about anywhere.
Practically speaking, it is probably easiest to run it on the project
manager's computer or team leader's computer. If you have access to a
shared network computer, you might decide to run it there instead;
however, you may occasionally need to interact with the graphical user
interface for the team dashboard instance, so you should not run it on
an inaccessible computer locked in a server room.</p>

<p>Creating a team dashboard instance is fairly simple:</p>

<ol>

<li>Install the Process Dashboard on the computer in question if it is
    not there already.</li>

<li>If you are running the team dashboard on the project manager's
    computer or the team leader's computer, then it will be common for
    them to have a personal dashboard instance as well.  This isn't a
    problem.  To create a second instance:</li>

    <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">

    <li>Make a copy of the shortcut you use to run the dashboard.
        Rename the shortcut with a name like &quot;Team
        Dashboard.&quot;</li>

    <li>Right click on your new shortcut and choose
        &quot;Properties.&quot;</li>

    <li>In the window that appears, change the &quot;Start in:&quot;
        field to name a different directory.  (By default, it will
        typically read &quot;<tt>C:\pspdata</tt>&quot;.)  Create a new
        directory on your hard drive (for example
        &quot;<tt>C:\teamdata</tt>&quot; - but anything is fine) and
        enter its name in the &quot;Start in&quot; field.</li>

    <li>Put your cursor at the end of the &quot;Target&quot; field,
        and append a space, followed by the double quote character
        (&quot;), followed by the words Team Dashboard, followed by
        another double quote character.  This will cause the words
        &quot;Team Dashboard&quot; to be displayed in the title bar of
        the Team Dashboard instance.</li>

    <li>Click OK</li>

    <li>Try launching the dashboard using your new shortcut.  The new
        shortcut should launch a dashboard instance that is completely
        independent from your original dashboard instance, and which
        displays &quot;Team Dashboard&quot; in its title bar.</li>

    </ol>

<li>Next, we'll configure the team dashboard to import data from the
    &quot;Team Data Directory.&quot; From the C menu on the team
    dashboard window, choose &quot;Tools <img src="Images/rarrow.png"> Import&quot;.  The Data Import
    Wizard will appear.  Select &quot;Import Project Metrics&quot; and
    click Next.  On the next screen:</li>

    <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">

    <li>Click the Browse button, and select the &quot;Team Data
        Directory.&quot;</li>

    <li><a name="doc58_dataPrefix"></a>For the data prefix, choose a string like
        &quot;<tt>/Imported/Team&nbsp;Project&nbsp;Name</tt>&quot;</li>

    <li>Make certain to choose the option to &quot;Import the data for
        future dashboard sessions, as well.&quot;</li>

    <li>Click the Next button.  If there are any metrics files present
        in the &quot;Team Data Directory,&quot; they will be imported
        immediately.  In the future, the dashboard will scan the
        contents of that directory every 10 minutes or so to see if
        any files have been created or updated, and will automatically
        import any new data it finds.</li></ol></ol>


<H4 NO_NUMBER>Configure Individual Dashboard Instances</H4>

Next, you should set up the Dashboard instances for each team member.
Have each team member follow these steps:

<ol>

<li>Install the Process Dashboard on the individual's computer if it
    is not there already.</li>

<li>Run the dashboard, and open the Hierarchy Editor.  Somewhere in
    your dashboard hierarchy, create a &quot;Node&quot; (using the
    &quot;Edit <img src="Images/rarrow.png"> Add&nbsp;Node&quot;
    menu) to represent the work you will perform for this project.
    Save the changes by selecting &quot;File <img src="Images/rarrow.png"> Save&quot; from the Hierarchy
    Editor window.  Close the Hierarchy Editor.<br>

    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt>(Later, when you
    begin planning your personal work for this project, you should
    create nodes and PSP templates representing project tasks.  These
    should be placed hierarchically <u>underneath</u> this project
    node to ensure that their metrics are included in the team
    rollup.)</li>

<li>From the C menu on the main dashboard window, choose Task and
    Schedule.  Create a new schedule to represent your project.  In
    the task list for this new schedule, <u>add the node</u> you
    created in step 2 above.  (For additional help on creating this
    earned value schedule, see the <a href="#doc32_top">Using the Task &amp;
    Schedule Tool</a> help topic.)  Save the schedule.  Close the Task
    &amp; Schedule window.</li>

<li>From the C menu on the main dashboard window, choose &quot;Tools
    <img src="Images/rarrow.png"> Export&quot;.  The Data Export
    Wizard will appear.  Select &quot;Export Project Metrics&quot; and
    click Next.  On the next screen:</li>

    <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">

    <li>Click the Browse button to select a file where data will be
        exported.  Choose a filename that includes your name or
        initials, and place the file in the &quot;Team Data
        Directory.&quot;</li>

    <li>In the hierarchy tree, select the node you created in step
        2 above.</li>

    <li>Make certain to choose the option to &quot;Export the data for
        future dashboard sessions, as well.&quot;</li>

    <li>Click the Next button.  The dashboard will export metrics data
        to the file you selected.  In the future, the dashboard will
        automatically export your most recent data each time it shuts
        down (or each night around midnight if you leave the dashboard
        running continually).</li></ol></ol>


<H4 NO_NUMBER>Create Team Rollups</H4>

Once all team members have configured their dashboards as described
above, data should be available to the team dashboard.  You'll want to
create two different types of team rollup: a rolled up earned value
schedule, and rolled up project metrics.

<H5 NO_NUMBER>Creating the Rolled-up Earned Value Schedule</H5>

<ol>

<li>Open the Team Dashboard instance and select &quot;Task &amp;
    Schedule&quot; from its C menu.  If it displays a window giving
    you an option to open an existing schedule, click &quot;New.&quot</li>

<li>When you see a dialog entitled &quot;Create New Schedule,&quot;
    enter a name for your team project schedule and select
    &quot;Create EV Roll-up&quot; from the drop-down list.  Click OK
    to create the new rollup schedule.</li>

<li>The window that appears should give you an opportunity to add
    schedules to the rollup; add each individual's schedule in turn.
    (If some individual's schedule does not appear in the list, then
    they have not correctly configured their personal dashboard as
    described above.)  Save the team rollup schedule.</li>

<li>You can view an HTML report of the team rollup schedule by
    clicking the &quot;Report&quot; button.</li></ol>


<H5 NO_NUMBER>Creating Rolled-up PSP Metrics</H5>

<ol>

<li>Open the Team Dashboard instance and select &quot;Hierarchy Editor&quot;
    from its C menu.</li>

<li>Highlight a node in the hierarchy editor like &quot;Project&quot;
    and select the &quot;Edit <img src="Images/rarrow.png"> Add
    Template <img src="Images/rarrow.png"> Rollup PSP Data&quot;
    menu option.  A new node will be created; give it a name
    appropriate for your project.  Save and close the Hierarchy
    Editor.</li>

<li>Use the Hierarchy Menus to navigate to the node you just created.
    Click the drop-down arrow to the right of the Script Button.
    Choose the &quot;Analyze Rollup Data&quot; option.  An analysis
    web page for the project will be displayed.  This web page rolls
    up data from PSP tasks in the project. (If people use a non-PSP
    process to perform their work, that data will not be rolled up
    into this analysis.)</li>

<li>By default, the analysis web page will include data from all the
    completed PSP tasks imported into the team dashboard instance.
    You can change the criteria by selecting the &quot;Edit Data
    Rollup Filter&quot; option on the Script Button's drop-down
    menu. By editing the values on the rollup filter form, you can
    instruct the rollup to include<ul>

      <li>Data from all PSP tasks, whether they are complete or not</li>
      <li>Data for all tasks with certain keywords (this can be a useful
          way to view a subset of the data in your project)</li></ul>

    If you choose to import metrics for more than one project into a
    single team dashboard instance, you can constrain this rollup to
    include data for only a single team project by entering the data
    import prefix (which you selected in <a href="#doc58_dataPrefix">step
    3b</a> of the &quot;Create Team Dashboard Instance&quot; steps
    above) into the field labelled &quot;Only rollup projects whose
    path starts with.&quot;<br>

    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt>If you find yourself
    editing the filter frequently to see different data views, you can
    instead repeat step 2 above to create any number of distinct
    rollups.  Then provide different filter criteria for each
    rollup.</li></ol>

<H2><a name="para_6_7_"></a>6.7. Localization Tool</H2>

<P>The dashboard has many users around the world.  To better support
all our users, we are currently working to internationalize the
dashboard.  The Process Dashboard includes a Localization Tool that
you can use to translate dashboard messages into your own language.
You can open the Localization Tool by selecting &quot;Tools&nbsp;<img src="Images/rarrow.png">&nbsp;Localization Tool&quot; from the
<a href="#doc45_top">configure menu</a>.</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/LocalizationToolMenu.png"></center></p>

<P>(Note that the menu option for the localization tool will not
normally appear for English-speaking users.)  The Localization Tool is
based upon the useful Zaval JRC Editor written by Victor Krapivin and
others (<u>http://www.zaval.org/products/jrc-editor/</u>).</P>

<P>The localization tool arranges translation keys hierarchically and
displays the resulting tree on the left.  Exclamation points indicate
keys that still need to be translated.  When you select a key in this
tree, the right hand side of the screen displays the English message
and a place for translation into your native language.</P>

<p><center><img src="Images/LocalizationTool.png"></center></p>

<P>Some translation keys end with the string "_FMT".  The English
message associated with these keys will contain expressions like
"{0}".  These translation items are Java MessageFormat strings; at
runtime, the "{0}" will be replaced with a dynamically generated
value.  To translate these items correctly, you will need to
understand the syntax of MessageFormat strings.  For more information
on MessageFormat syntax, visit
<u>http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/api/java/text/MessageFormat.html</u></P>

<P>Other translations may contain cross-references.  A cross-reference
is a translation key surrounded by curly braces, with a '$' sign in
front; an example would be <tt>${some.other.key}</tt>.  When the
dashboard sees a cross-reference, it looks up the translation
described by the named key, and replaces the reference with that
translation.</P>

<P>Cross-references are designed to reduce the burden of translating
the dashboard, without sacrificing expressiveness.  For example, the
English word "Plan" may be used in two different places inside the
dashboard, but it may have different meanings (for example, in English
the word "Plan" might be used as a noun, a verb, or an adjective).  In
another language, different words might be needed to capture these
different meanings.  Thus, the dashboard might define the following
translation keys:
<PRE>     Plan=Plan
     Plan_Noun=${Plan}
     Plan_Verb=${Plan}
     Plan_Adjective=${Plan}</PRE>

This approach has two benefits.  If your language, like English,
reuses the same word in all these situations, then you will only need
to translate the "Plan" key, and the other three keys will follow
along automatically.  If, however, your language requires different
words for one or more of these situations, you can edit the other keys,
deleting the cross-reference entirely and entering your translation
instead.</P>

<P>After you enter translations, click on the Save icon.  Your new
translations will take effect the next time you restart the process
dashboard.</P>

<P>The localizations you enter will be saved automatically into a file
with a name like "pspdash_*.jar".  This file will be saved into the
directory where you installed the process dashboard (normally
<u>C:\Program&nbsp;Files\Process&nbsp;Dashboard</u> for Windows
users).  This file is formatted as a
<a href="#doc13_addon">Process Dashboard Add-on</a>,
and can be easily shared with other dashboard users.  Give them a copy
of the file and instruct them to save it into the directory where they
installed the Process Dashboard, and they can benefit from your
translations as well.</P>

<P>If you choose to use the Localization Tool, please consider sharing
your translations with the Process Dashboard development team.  This
will allow users around the world to benefit from your translation
efforts.  The Localization Tool can share your translations
automatically if you give your consent.  (Note that automatic sharing
will not work if you have to use an HTTP proxy server to connect to
the internet.  No error message will be displayed in this case.  If
you would like to share translations, but you are behind an HTTP proxy
server, please email a copy of your "pspdash_*.jar" file to
<u>processdash-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</u>)</P>

<P><b>Note:</b> <a href="#doc23_top">copyright
restrictions</a> do not allow for the translation of PSP process
materials (e.g. scripts and forms) into other languages.  As a result,
the Localization Tool does not support the translation of these items.</P>
