<h1>Join Team Project (Team Members)</h1>

<p>As an individual, your personal historical data is very useful for
planning, tracking, and personal process improvement.  So the dashboard
strives to let you keep all of your personal historical data in one place.
You can use a single Process Dashboard dataset to collect all of your personal
data, even if you move from team to team and work on many different projects
over time.  Because of this flexibility, you must tell the dashboard when you
are joining a new team project.</p>

<p>Before you can join the project, you must have successfully
installed the Process Dashboard. Start the Process Dashboard and leave
it running.</p>

<p>Your team leader will send you a special URL that you can use to
join the team project. Open that URL in a Web browser.</p>

<p>If you get an error message like "Server not found" or "This page
cannot be displayed" when you attempt to visit this page, contact your
team leader and ask for help.  They may ask you to try again with a
different URL, or they may ask you to perform special steps as described
in the <a href="NetworkTroubleshooting.html#indivSteps">Troubleshooting
Network Connectivity</a> help topic.</p>

<p>When the Team Project Setup Wizard appears successfully, it will walk
you through the steps involved in joining the team project. Read each page
carefully and supply the information requested.</p>

<p>One of the pages in the Wizard will ask for your name and initials.  Your
team leader may tell you which initials you should use for this particular
team project.  (If you enter the wrong initials, do not worry; you can easily
fix them later by opening the Project Parameters and Settings page for this
team project.)</p>

<p>When the wizard finishes, you can close the browser window.</p>
