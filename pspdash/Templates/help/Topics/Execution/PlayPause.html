<H1>Using the play/pause button</H1>

<P>The play/pause button gives access to the timer that is built into the 
dashboard.</P>

<p><center><img src="../../Images/PointToPlayPauseButton.png"></center></p>

<P>The dashboard timer makes it easy to measure the amount of time spent in 
the various phases of your development process.  When you start the timer, it
will automatically make appropriate entries in your <a 
href="UsingTimeLogEditor.html">time log</a> for the project/task which you
have made active with the <a href="HierarchyMenus.html">hierarchy
menus</a>.</P>

<P>By default, the play/pause button shows a triangle when the timer <em>IS 
NOT</em> running.  The intent is that the picture shows what will happen when 
it is pressed (pressing the play button will cause the timer to start).  Once 
pressed, the button image changes from the triangle to a pair of vertical 
bars.  When the vertical bars are displayed, the timer <em>IS</em> running.  
Again, the intent is to show what will happen when the button is pressed at 
this point (pressing the pause button will cause the timer to pause).</P>

<P>If you would prefer to see the triangle when the timer <em>IS</em> 
currently running (i.e. you would rather see the current state of the timer 
on the button), you can override this default behavior by adding an entry to 
the configuration file.  Adding the following line to the configuration file 
will cause the play and pause symbols to reverse their meaning:</P>

<pre>pauseButton.showCurrent=true</pre>

<P>For more information about the configuration file see the <a 
href="../AdvancedTopics/ConfigurationFile.html">configuration file</a> help 
topic.</P>

<p>It is <b>not</b> necessary to stop the timer before using the hierarchy
menus to change the active project/task/phase.  You can leave the timer in
"play" mode as you move from one phase to another, and it will properly
finalize one entry in the time log, and open another.</p>

<a name="timelogdelay"></a><p>When the timer is running and you first navigate
to an activity, you will notice that the dashboard will not create an entry in
the time log until you have spent a full minute there; this is by design.
Navigating from one task to another may require multiple interactions with the
hierarchy menus, which necessarily implies that the "active" project/task will
momentarily pass through several intermediate states before finally arriving at
the desired task.  You would <u>not</u> want the dashboard to create extraneous
entries in the time log for all those intermediate tasks; therefore, the
dashboard waits and creates the time log entry only after you have logged 60
seconds worth of elapsed time to an activity.</p>

<a name="sound"></a><P>When you start the timer, it will make a short 
"clicking" sound to let you know it is timing you.  You can leave the timer 
running as you move from phase to phase and project to project, and it will 
play the "timing sound" as you navigate to each new project/phase.  Once 
again, the sound is there to remind you that the dashboard is timing you; the 
sound will <b>not</b> play if the timer is not running.  Therefore, as you 
move from one project/phase to another, if you expect to hear the sound and 
do not (or vice versa), check the state of the timer.</p>

<a name="pullDown"></a><h2>The play/pause button pull-down control</h2>
<P>The play/pause button contains a pull-down control that can be used to
quickly jump to a point on the project tree where you have recently recorded
time.  This provides another way of navigating to a project or project phase
in which you were recently working.</p>

<p><center><img src="../../Images/PointToPlayPausePullDownShowMenu.png"></center></p>

<P>In this example, the dashboard has already recorded time in both the 
Design and Planning phases of the project.  If one of these items is chosen, 
the dashboard will jump to that phase and continue.  If the timer is 
currently running it will stop in the current phase recording the elapsed 
time, switch to the chosen phase, and start recording time in the newly 
chosen phase.</p>

<!-- DISCLAIMER -->

<P>The items in the pull-down are not limited to the phases of the current
project. Therefore, the pull-down control is very useful when you are
juggling several activities. If you keep bouncing back and forth between
several unrelated activities, you can quickly jump to a recent activity and
log time there by using the pull-down menu.</P>
