<h1>Master Project Coordination and Planning</h1>

<p>Different organizations use different approaches to the planning of
a master project. One common approach is to conduct simultaneous
launch meetings for all of the team projects that make up a master
project. If your organization uses this approach, you will find the
information in this section useful.</p>

<h2>Accessing Team Project Tools</h2>

<p>Each team project will be performing team planning tasks
simultaneously, but by design only one read-write copy of the Team
Dashboard can be open at a time. This requires a slightly modified
approach to accessing the Team Project Tools and Settings.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in this document, team leaders are advised to open the
Team Dashboard if it is not already running.  In a master project
environment, you should take these steps instead:</p>

<ol>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>The <u>leader of the master project</u>
should open the Team Dashboard on an appropriate computer.</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>If this computer has a personal firewall
installed, it should either be temporarily disabled, or configured to
allow incoming connections to port 3000 from within the local area
network (LAN).</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>The leader of
the master project should perform these steps for each team project:

    <ul>

    <li style='margin-top:6pt'>Navigate to the team project using the
    hierarchy menus on the main dashboard window.</li>

    <li style='margin-top:6pt'>Use the script button drop-down menu to
    open the Team Project Tools and Settings page for the team
    project.</li>

    <li style='margin-top:6pt'>Scroll to the bottom of the page and
    find the link with the following label:

    <p style='margin-left:1cm;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>You can view this page from another
computer by visiting:<br>
    <span style='margin-left:1cm;text-decoration:underline;color:blue'>http://computer-name:3000/Project/Path/+/ABC-v1/team_tools.shtm</span></p>

    </li>

    <li style='margin-top:6pt'>Copy and paste this hyperlink, and send
    it to the team leader for the project in question.</li>

    <li style='margin-top:6pt'>The team leader can open this hyperlink
    in their web browser to access their project's team list, WBS
    Editor, project plan summary, and other tools.</li>

    </ul>


<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>Leave the Team Dashboard running during
the planning sessions.</li>

</ol>


<table border=0><tr>

<td><img width=60 height=24 src="../Images/finger.png"></td>

<td><b>Important:</b> Because organizations have different network
configurations, you should perform a dry run of these steps before
your launch. This way, if you encounter connectivity problems, you can
enlist your local tech support team in finding a resolution before the
launch begins, and avoid disruptions to the team planning
process.</td>

<h2>Viewing Consolidated Master Project Planning Data</h2>

<p>While the individual project teams are developing their detailed
plans, it is easy to see a master project view of the planning
progress. Simply follow these steps:</p>

<ol>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>If you followed the steps above, the
leader of the master project should already have the Team Dashboard
open and running.</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>In the Team Dashboard, navigate to the
master project. Then select View Bottom-Up Work Breakdown Structure
from the script button's drop-down menu.

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/wbs-master-bottom-up.png"></p></li>


<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>This window displays a WBS containing
all of the components and tasks declared by all of the team projects
that belong to this master project. Since the data is rolled up and
computed, it is read-only. If you display the Bottom Up Time Panel, it
will show the planned completion dates of each team project.</li>


<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>The data in this window will update in
near-real-time. Each time a team project saves changes to their WBS,
this window will see the changes within a few seconds, and recalculate
its display.</li>

</ol>
