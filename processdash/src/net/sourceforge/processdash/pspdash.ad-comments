# This file contains documentation for each user setting.  When saving
# user preferences, the documentation string will be written out as a
# comment immediately preceeding the particular setting.
#

autoRealization=Policy for auto-realization of data. To save time and \
	memory, formulas are not immediately calculated when the dashboard \
	opens.  Instead, they are calculated (realized) at some later time. \
	This realization always occurs automatically when their value must \
	be displayed for the first time on a chart, form, or report.  In \
	addition, a background process runs when the the dashboard starts, \
	and slowly calculates formulas.  If this setting has the value \
	"full", all data will be automatically realized by this background \
	process.  If this setting has the value "min", only global (e.g. \
	"To Date") data is auto-realized (the default). If this setting has \
	the value "none", no data will be auto-realized.  If you are on a \
	slow computer, and you notice irritating delays the first time you \
	view a chart, form, or report, try using the "full" option.  If \
	you experience irritating delays when saving edits to the hierarchy, \
	try using the "min" or "none" options.

autoUpdate.disabled=If this property is set to "true", the dashboard will \
	not automatically perform a monthly check for updated versions \
	of the dashboard software or the add-on process sets.

autoUpdate.lastCheckDate=This is the last date when the dashboard was able \
	to successfully check for updated versions of the dashboard software \
	and add-on process sets.  (Measured in milliseconds since Jan 1, 1970.)

autoUpdate.proxyPassword=When running in the context of an auto-redirecting \
	HTTP proxy server, use this password to authenticate.

autoUpdate.proxyUsername=When running in the context of an auto-redirecting \
	HTTP proxy server, use this username to authenticate.

autoUpdate.remind=Remind the user about available software updates the next \
	time the dashboard starts, even if a check has been performed recently.

browser.command=The command to execute to run an HTML browser for script \
	files. If left unset, the default will be Netscape on non-windows \
	platforms (netscape must be in your path), or the system default \
	browser on Windows.

browser.readonly.color=In Internet Explorer, read-only data elements on \
	forms will be flagged with this background color.

console.showMenuOption=If this property is set to "true", the help menu \
	will contain an option for displaying debugging output.

dataFreezing.disabled=If this property is set to "true", the data \
	freezing/thawing mechanism will be disabled.

dateFormat=A list of recognized date formats, separated by the | character. \
	The first format in the list will be used when displaying dates. \
	For valid format syntax, see the documentation for \
	java.text.SimpleDateFormat in the Sun Java Developer Kit.

dateTimeFormat=A list of recognized date-time formats, separated by the | \
	character. The first format in the list will be used when \
	displaying date-times.  For valid format syntax, see the \
	documentation for java.text.SimpleDateFormat in the Sun Java \
	Developer Kit.

defectDialog.autostart=If this property is set to "true", the defect dialog \
	box will come up with the timer already running.  Any other value \
	for this property means the user must manually press the "Start \
	Timing" button to begin the timer for fixing the defect.

defectDialog.phaseMap=The following property describes common defect \
	injection/removal patterns.  It should be a list of phase pairs; \
	the pairs should be separated from each other by "|" characters. \
	Each pair should be of the form "phase A=>phase B"; each pair is \
	interpreted to mean "Often defects are injected in phase A, and \
	removed in phase B."  When you remove a defect during phase B of a \
	process, it will then use phase A as the default injection phase.

defectDialog.restrictSequence=If this property is set to "true" (the \
	default), the defect dialog will check injection and removal phases \
	to ensure that defects are NOT removed before they are injected. \
	(You might want to disable this feature if you make use of iterative \
	processes where the real-life task sequence does not strictly follow \
	the order the of nodes in the hierarchy.)

defectTypeStandard=The name of the default defect type standard.

excel.exportMethod=The method to use for exporting data into Excel. If this \
	is set to "mime", tables will be exported to Excel using a mime-type. \
	If this is set to "iqy", tables will be exported using a Microsoft \
	Internet Web Query (.IQY) file.  Set this to "none" if you don't \
	have Excel and don't care to see the "Export to Excel" link \
	underneath tables.  If left unset, the export method will be icy \
	if your browser is Internet Explorer, and mime otherwise.

export.data=A set of instructions for automatic export of data. This property \
	should be a series of export instructions, separated by the vertical \
	bar character '|'.  Each export instruction is of the form \
	"filename=>path-list".  The filename is the destination for data \
	export.  The path-list is a semicolon ";" separated list of \
	hierarchy prefixes that should be exported; data elements whose \
	names begin with one of these prefixes will be exported to the \
	named file.

ev.enableRollup=If true, enable the rollup of earned value.

ev.showCumulativeTaskData=If true, show the "cumulative planned value" \
	and "cumulative planned time" columns in the earned value task \
	list. These columns are hidden by default.

ev.simpleForecastDate=If true, use simple, published earned value formulas \
	to calculate "independent forecast date".  By default, use the \
	additional information present in the schedule to improve the \
	quality of the forecast.

ev.sortCompletedTasks=If false, the planned completion dates for tasks \
	in an earned value plan will be generated based upon their order \
	alone.  By default, the task list will be automatically sorted so \
	completed tasks appear at the beginning of the list, in the order \
	they were completed.

extDoc.openMethod=If this is set to "redirect", then an HTTP redirect \
	message will be used to open external documents.

hiddenData=Data names to be suppressed from user-visible data lists (by \
	default).  This property should be a series of regular expressions \
	matching data names, separated by the vertical bar character '|'.

http.allowRemote=For data privacy reasons, http connections are rejected \
	unless they originate from localhost.  To accept http connections \
	from remote hosts, set this property to true.

http.hostname=When the dashboard crafts an URL to an item on this \
	dashboard instance, it will use this host name.

http.port=The port number where the dashboard should listen for incoming \
	http connections.  If left unset, port 2468 will be used. (Note: \
	the port one number less than this port - typically 2467 - must be \
	available also, for incoming data connections.)

import.directories=The following property lists automatic data import \
	directories.  It should be a list of prefix/directory pairs; the \
	pairs should be separated from each other by "|" characters.  Each \
	pair should be of the form "prefix=>directory/path"; each pair is \
	interpreted to mean "watch directory/path for files, and import \
	them into the dashboard with a name beginning with "/prefix/".

pauseButton.historySize=The maximum number of entries which should be \
	retained in the play/pause button's history list.

pauseButton.showCurrent=If this property is set to "true", the Play/Pause \
	button will display the current state (i.e., while paused, it will \
	display the PAUSE symbol).  Otherwise, the button will display the \
	effect of a click (i.e., while paused, it will display the PLAY \
	symbol).

pauseButton.quiet=If this property is set to "true", the Play/Pause button \
	will not provide any audible feedback.

probeDialog.dataList=If this property is set to "simple", the PROBE dialog \
	will only display data elements relating to the standard PROBE \
	methods A,B,C, and D. If this setting has any other value, PROBE will \
	display an exhaustive list of data element choices for correlating.

probeDialog.onlyCompleted=If this property is set to "true", the probe \
	dialog box will automatically filter the list of data points so \
	that it only contains tasks which are marked as completed.

probeWizard.strictTimeMethods=If this property is set to "true", the \
	probe wizard will strictly adhere to printed calculation errors \
	in the PROBE script.  By default, the probe wizard will correct \
	errors in the calculations.

pspdiff.suffix.c=a space-separated list of filename extensions (e.g. \
	".c .h .java") which signal that a file contains C/Java source code.

pspdiff.suffix.cobol=a space-separated list of filename extensions (e.g. \
	".cob .cbl") which signal that a file contains COBOL source code.

pspdiff.suffix.pascal=a space-separated list of filename extensions (e.g. \
	".pas") which signal that a file contains Pascal source code.

pspdiff.suffix.sh=a space-separated list of filename extensions (e.g. \
	".pl .sh") which signal that a file contains perl or sh source code.

pspdiff.suffix.sql=a space-separated list of filename extensions (e.g. \
	".sql .ada") which signal that a file contains SQL or Ada source code.

stateFile=The default location for the user's state file.

templates.directory=Supplemental locations of system-wide template files. \
	This can be a semicolon-separated list of directories that contain \
	dashboard process template and supporting files. Each entry in \
	the list should end in "/Templates".

timelog.updateInterval=The dashboard saves the current time log entry \
	periodically.  This setting specifies the number of minutes it \
	should wait between saves.
