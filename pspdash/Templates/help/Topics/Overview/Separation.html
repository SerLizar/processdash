<h1>PSP<sup>(SM)</sup> Process Distribution</h1>

<p>The Process Dashboard is a general-purpose tool designed to support
the enactment of any defined process.  It is especially useful for
supporting metrics-intensive, high-maturity processes.  Although the
dashboard is best known for its support of the Personal Software
Process<sup>(SM)</sup> (PSP), it can be used just as effectively with
any defined process.  In addition, many features of the dashboard,
such as the earned value tracking tool, can be used independently of a
defined process.</p>

<p>The first versions of the dashboard were distributed with PSP
scripts and forms bundled-in.  The dashboard development team was
originally under the impression that this was permitted, since the
copyright page of the PSP book contains the statement:

<blockquote>The tables in appendix C of this book or electronic copies
thereof may be copied, used, or modified by owners of this book or
users of the materials it contains.</blockquote>

The dashboard development team originally interpreted this statement
as written permission from the publisher to make electronic copies of
the scripts and forms in Appendix C of the book <u>A&nbsp;Discipline
for Software Engineering</u>, and incorporate those materials into the
dashboard download.  (Apparently, other development teams must have
made the same assumption, because several other PSP tools already in
existence in 1997 also included PSP scripts and forms.)</p>

<p>However, in February of 2002, Watts Humphrey (the author of the PSP
book) brought it to our attention that the statement in the book does
not grant permission to <u>distribute</u> electronic copies of the PSP
scripts and forms.  At that time, he instructed us to discontinue all
downloads of the Process Dashboard, and to instruct our users that
they were to desist in the usage of the program.</p>

<p>Mr. Humphrey worked with Addison-Wesley to arrange permission for
the PSP scripts and forms to once again be distributed for use with
the dashboard, but only under the condition that users consent to a
license agreement:</p>

<blockquote>Although I understand that I may use the Personal Software
Process<SUP>SM</SUP> (PSP<SUP>SM</SUP>) materials provided with this
Dashboard tool, I will not copy, modify, or distribute these materials
without first obtaining written permission from
Addison-Wesley. Furthermore, I will not represent myself as using the
PSP process unless I have been trained to do so by an SEI-authorized
PSP instructor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The PSP was developed by Watts S. Humphrey and is
described in his book, <u>A Discipline for Software
Engineering</u>. The PSP provides a powerful way to develop software,
but it is effective only if properly used. While this tool aids
trained professionals in applying the PSP methods, it does not provide
instruction on how to use the PSP.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Personal Software Process and PSP are service marks of
Carnegie Mellon University.</blockquote>

<p>With this permission in place, we were once again able to offer the
dashboard for download, beginning in March of 2002.</p>

<p>Since that time, however, we have received complaints from many
users about this license agreement.  Several individuals have pointed
out that this additional license agreement conflicts with the terms of
the <a href="gpl.html">GNU Public License</a> (under which the
dashboard is distributed).  Upon advice from the Free Software
Foundation, and after receiving a modified
<a href="PermissionLetter.html">permission letter</a> from
Addison-Wesley, we have removed the PSP scripts and forms from the
Process Dashboard distribution, and moved them into a separately
downloaded file.  The main Process Dashboard distribution is once
again freely available under the terms of the GPL, and the PSP
materials are separately available under the terms of the license
agreement displayed above.</p>
