<h1>Team Project Migration Needed</h1>

<p>Your team leader has chosen to migrate this team project to a new,
streamlined data format.  This will provide several benefits for you,
such as a reduction in memory usage and faster export operations on
shutdown.</p>

<p>Your cooperation is needed for this effort.  When you click the
"Continue" button below, the dashboard will take the following
steps:</p>

<ul>

<li style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em'>First, your personal
plan will be scanned for potential problems that could interfere with
the migration.  If any problems are found, the dashboard will display
a list of corrective actions that you need to take.  In most cases, no
problems will be detected, so the migration will begin right
away.</li>

<li style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em'>Next, your personal
Process Dashboard will be shut down to perform the migration.  The
migration tool will upgrade your personal plan to the new data format,
then restart your dashboard.</li>

<li style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em'>After the dashboard
restarts, it may be necessary for you to perform a final "Synchronize
to WBS" operation. The dashboard will alert you if this sync is
needed.</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Please note:</b> Until you complete the steps above, the
dashboard will not be able to copy new task assignments from the team
work breakdown structure.  Thus, you should attempt to migrate your
data as soon as possible.  If you encounter any problems during the
migration, contact your team leader right away for help.</p>

<p>If you are ready to begin the migration process, click the
"Continue" button below.</p>
