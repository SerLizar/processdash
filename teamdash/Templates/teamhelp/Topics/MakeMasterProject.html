<h1>Optional: Create Master Project (Program Leader)</h1>

<p>In the Process Dashboard, a <b>Team Project</b> allows data to be
rolled up data from several individuals to the team level. For larger
projects, it may also be necessary to roll up data from several team
projects to the program level. <b>Master Projects</b> are designed to
meet this need.</p>

<p>To create a new master project, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>Start the Team Dashboard using the
appropriately named shortcut on the team leader's computer. The Team
Dashboard will start. (If your personal dashboard is also running, you
can easily distinguish the Team Dashboard because it displays "Team
Dashboard" in the title bar, and displays a different icon for the
window.)</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>On the C menu of the team dashboard,
choose the Hierarchy menu item. The Hierarchy Editor window will
appear.</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>In the Hierarchy Editor, highlight a
node in the hierarchy such as the top-level Project node. On the Edit
menu, choose Add Template&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Team Project. A new node
called Team Project will be created; give it a short name that
describes the master project. Choose File&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Save, then
File&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Close.</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>Using the dashboard Hierarchy Menus,
navigate to the project you just created. Click the dashboard Script
Button to display the Team Project Setup Wizard.</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>The Team Project Setup Wizard will
appear. Read each page carefully and supply the information
requested. One page of the wizard will ask whether you wish to create
a team project or a master project; choose the Master Project
option.</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>At one point, the Team Project Setup Wizard
will give you an opportunity to select the directory where you would like
to store data for this master project.  By default, it will encourage you
to store data into the <a href="TeamConfigDir.html">team configuration
directory</a>.  Most teams are <b>strongly</b> encouraged to keep this
default, as it is simpler and less confusing to keep all your data in one
place.  If you have a compelling need to place <i>master project</i> data
in a separate location than <i>configuration</i> data, you can alter this
path.  However, the directory you choose <b><u>must meet</u></b> all of the
same <a href="TeamConfigDir.html#criteria">accessibility and permissions
criteria</a> as the team configuration directory.</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>When the wizard finishes, you can close
the browser window.</li>

</ol>
