<H1>Entering process data</H1>
<P>There are two main ways of entering data into the Process Dashboard.  The 
first is through various input tools and dialogs provided by the dashboard 
(e.g. the <a 
href="../Execution/EnteringDefects.html">defect dialog</a>, the <A
HREF="../Execution/UsingTimeLogEditor.html">time log editor</A>, etc.).</p>

<p>The second is through the various PSP forms.  The scripts and forms are provided
through an integrated web interface.  See the <a
href="../Execution/AccessingScripts.html">Accessing Process Scripts</a>
help topic for more info on how to access the scripts and forms.  To find out
more information about the different process scripts and forms that are available,
see the <a href="../Overview/ProcessScripts.html">process scripts</a> help
topic.</p>


<!-- DISCLAIMER -->

<h2>The nature of the dashboard forms</h2>
<P>The dashboard forms are implemented via static and sometimes dynamic
HTML pages. Unlike the HTML forms you see on the internet, the forms on
these HTML pages are &quot;live&quot; at all times, much like a
spreadsheet. You can type values in the input fields and other fields will
recalculate automatically, even if those fields are in different browser
windows. There is no need to press any kind of &quot;submit data&quot;
button.</P>

<P>After typing in a value, you must generally &quot;leave&quot; that input
field to signal that you are finished entering information.&nbsp; Pressing
the &quot;Tab&quot; key (to move to the next input field) or clicking
anywhere else on the page is generally sufficient.&nbsp; As soon as the
&quot;input cursor&quot; leaves the field in question, the dashboard will
automatically pick up your data, recalculate related data items, and save
your data for future sessions.</P>

<P>If you enter an invalid value in for a data item (for example, typing
&quot;foo&quot; in an input field that is expecting a number), the
dashboard will reject the invalid value and restore the previous value for
that input field.</P>

<P>When a required data value is <I>missing</I>, the dashboard will display
&quot;<code>?????</code>&quot;. This is an indication that you still need
to enter a value for that data item. Therefore, you should ensure that
there are no &quot;<code>?????</code>&quot; symbols in the &quot;<B>Plan</B>&quot;
column of your project plan summary before marking the <B>Planning</B> 
phase complete.&nbsp; Similarly, make certain you fill in all missing
values in the &quot;<B>Actual</B>&quot; column of your project plan summary
before marking the project complete.</P>

<P>If the dashboard cannot recalculate a formula because the formula
references a missing (&quot;<code>?????</code>&quot;) or otherwise invalid data value,
it will display &quot;<code>#VALUE!</code>&quot; as the result of the calculation.&nbsp;
When you see &quot;<code>#VALUE!</code>&quot; in a dashboard form, it almost <I>always</I>
means that there is a &quot;<code>?????</code>&quot; field somewhere that you still need
to fill in.</P>

<P>If the dashboard recalculates a formula and encounters a divide-by-zero
error, it will display &quot;<code>#DIV/0!</code>&quot; as the result of the
calculation.&nbsp; Divide-by-zero errors are common when you first begin
using the dashboard, since you will not have any historical data.</P>

<P>To make all this possible, the dashboard software actually contains a very small 
HTTP server embedded within it.  This server allows communication between the 
HTML pages and the process data that is tracked by the dashboard.&nbsp; If
you close the dashboard program while one of the HTML forms is open, the
form will reset and display &quot;<code>NO&nbsp;CONNECTION</code>&quot;. You can reestablish
the connection simply by restarting the dashboard, then telling your
browser to reload the HTML
page.</P>

<h2>Exporting form data</h2>

<p>When you open a dashboard form, the form connects to the process
dashboard to retrieve the most up-to-date values for all the data elements
on the page.  If you choose the &quot;File <IMG BORDER="0"
SRC="../../Images/rarrow.png" WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="9"> Save&quot; option from
your browser, you will find that only the form is saved; the values
contained in the form are not.  If you want to save an electronic copy of a
dashboard form (for example, to email to a coworker, or to save with
project documentation), click the &quot;Export to HTML&quot; link at the
bottom of the page.  The dashboard will create an HTML version of the form
containing a <i>snapshot</i> of your data.  This HTML snapshot can be saved
using the &quot;File <IMG BORDER="0" SRC="../../Images/rarrow.png"
WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="9"> Save&quot; option of your browser.</p>

<p>If you would like to perform additional analysis on the data in a
dashboard form, use the &quot;Export to Excel&quot; link at the bottom of
the page. This will open the form in Excel, where you can reference the
data in Excel charts and equations.  <b>Important:</b> the Excel version of
the form contains <i>exported</i> data only.  If you edit values in the
Excel spreadsheet, your changes will not be imported back into the Process
Dashboard. To change a data value in the Process Dashboard, you must make
the change in a dashboard form.</p>

<h2>Read-only data fields</h2>

<P>The Process Dashboard automatically calculates many data elements for
you.  Normally, these calculated data values are not directly editable, but
rather they will update when other data elements to which they are related
get updated.  If you are using Internet Explorer, these values are
displayed with a grey background.</p>

<P>Sometimes you may decide that you want to <b> override</b> one or more
of these calculated values.  You can "unlock" these read-only data elements
by clicking on the &quot;<u>Unlock read-only data</u>&quot; link at the
bottom of the page.  Unlocking read-only data will make all the elements on
the page editable, allowing you to override calculated values with your
own.</p>

<P>Unlocking read-only data is useful for times when you intentionally want
to override a calculation, but it is not without risk.  Once you have
overridden a calculation, it will no longer automatically update in
response to changes in related data items.  In addition, related
calculations may no longer add up like you would normally expect.
Therefore, this feature should be used with caution.</p>

<p>After you have overridden a calculation with some value, you may decide
that you want the old calculation back.  Just type<code><b> DEFAULT
</b></code>in the input field, and when you leave the field the old
calculation will be restored.</p>
