<p>When a team begins a new project iteration, they often hold a project
relaunch meeting.  During that meeting, they create a detailed plan for the
new iteration.</p>

<p>A Relaunch Wizard is available that can help you create a starting point
for the new iteration plan.  The relaunch wizard will:</p>

<ul>

<li>Mark the "<tt><!--#echo var=PATH_TRANSLATED --></tt>" project as
<b><u>closed</u></b>, indicating that no additional work will be performed
there.</li>

<li>Create a new Team Project to hold the plan for the new iteration.</li>

<li>Copy the workflows, milestones, and team member schedules from the old
plan to the new plan.</li>

<li>Copy incomplete components and tasks from the old plan to the new plan,
and adjust the planned times of in-progress tasks to account for work that
has already been performed.</li>

</ul>

<!--#replace token=PID var=[Team_Process_PID] -->

<p class="error">The "<!--#echo var=PATH_TRANSLATED -->" project is based
upon the PID metrics collection framework.  Version 
<!--#echo Dash_Package_PID --> of that framework is currently installed on
this computer.  Unfortunately, the Relaunch Wizard is only available in
version 4.1.0 and higher.  Before you can use the Relaunch Wizard, you will
need to upgrade the framework.</p>

<p>If you received the PID framework from someone in your organization,
contact that individual to see if they have a newer version.  If you
created the framework yourself, follow the steps
<a href="http://www.processdash.com/upgradeMcf">on this page</a> to upgrade
the framework.</p>
