<h1>Refining your Personal Project Plan (Team Member)</h1>

<p>With the team project launch complete, your dashboard will contain
a list of project tasks for you to perform. These tasks appear
underneath the team project in your dashboard hierarchy.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/team-indiv-example-src.png"></p>

<p>As you work on the project, your understanding of these tasks will
grow, and you may need to alter your original plan. If you discover
that a task is much larger or smaller than originally anticipated, you
can change the estimate for the task by clicking on the Percent Spent
indicator.  (This is the blue or red bar that appears to the right of
the play/pause button.)  You can also edit time estimates by opening
your earned value task &amp; schedule plan, and changing the numbers
in the PT (Planned Time) column. </p>

<p>Of course, it is also common to discover new tasks that need to be
performed and changes to existing tasks. If you need to create a new
task, rename a task, subdivide a task, or delete a task, click the
down arrow to the right of the script button, and choose Open Team
Work Breakdown Structure. You can make changes to the tasks in the
Work Breakdown Structure, and when you save the changes they will
appear in your personal plan.  Take care as you edit the work
breakdown structure; since it is shared by the entire team, the
changes you make can affect your team members as well.</p>

<p>Some team leaders may choose to lock down the work breakdown
structure. In that case, you may be able to look at the Work Breakdown
Structure, but will not be able to make changes. If so, you may need
to ask your team leader or planning manager to make changes on your
behalf.</p>

<p>Another approach is also possible, but is less convenient: you may
define new project tasks and refine existing project tasks using the
dashboard Hierarchy Editor. You can open the Hierarchy Editor by
selecting Hierarchy from the C menu on the main process dashboard
window.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/indiv-hierarchy-editor.png"></p>

<p>Under the node for the team project, you will find nodes
representing components of the overall system your team is building
(for example, Component A in the picture above). Underneath those
nodes, you will find nodes that represent tasks you need to
perform. In the picture above, the nodes SW Design Task, SW Design
Review Task, PSP, and Code Inspect Task represent tasks that were
assigned to you. Finally, underneath the tasks, you will find phases.
The Code Inspect node in the picture above is a phase. </p>

<p>Tasks can be created and nested to any depth. To add new tasks or
refine existing tasks, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>Decide where you want to add the new
task. Highlight the component or task that should be ultimately be the
parent of the new task you wish to create. (The best way to refine a
task is to add multiple children underneath the existing task.)</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>From the Edit menu, choose Add
Template. If you want to use the PSP to accomplish the new task,
choose one of the PSP processes listed. Otherwise, look through the
list of tasks options provided. Separate task options are provided for
each type of task in your team's organizational process. Choose the
option that most accurately describes the work you plan to do. A task
of that type will be created in your hierarchy.</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>Give the new task a meaningful name that
describes the work involved.</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>Repeat steps 1-3 as needed to create
additional tasks. When you are finished editing your project tasks,
you can save your changes by selecting Save from the File menu.</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>Tasks added to your plan in this manner
will automatically appear in your personal earned value schedule, but
will not initially have any time estimate assigned.  To ensure that
your earned value schedule produces meaningful forecasts, you should
open your earned value schedule next and enter time estimates for each
new task.</li>

</ol>


<p>As you edit tasks in your team project, you will notice
several restrictions:</p>

<ul>

<li>To ensure that metrics rollup correctly, you cannot edit the names
of phases or project components.</li>

<li>Some tasks in your list are PSP tasks, which use a defined PSP
process. To protect the integrity of the defined process, you cannot
add additional items to a PSP task.</li>

</ul>
