<H1>Counting LOC</H1>

<p>Measuring size is an important step in the PSP Postmortem phase. If you 
don't pause in your project postmortem to measure the number of added, 
deleted, and modified LOC, you may forever lose the opportunity to capture 
these metrics. It only takes a few moments, and provides you with valuable 
data for future planning efforts.</p> 

<P>You may already have a LOC counter that you use on a regular basis. (In 
fact, most people who complete the PSP training course write a LOC counter 
during the training.) If you do need a LOC counter, one is built into the 
dashboard.</p>

<h2>The LOC Counter Tool</h2>

<p>You can access this LOC counter by selecting the appropriate option from
the &quot;C <img border="0" src="../../Images/rarrow.png" width="12"
height="9"> Tools&quot; menu.  The LOC Counter Tool can count code in several
different ways.</p>

<h3>Counting LOC in regular files</h2>

<p>The "Files" tab of the LOC Counter allows you to count LOC in a single
file or in a directory.  It also allows you to compare two different files or
directories to see how many lines of code were added, modified, and deleted.
Just select the appropriate option at the top, then select the files or
directories in the fields below. Then press the Count button.</p>

<h3>Counting LOC changes from Subversion</h3>

<p>If you use subversion for version control of your source code, the "SVN"
tab makes it easy to count the number of lines of code that were added,
deleted, and modified by a particular set of changes.  To begin, select the
directory on your computer that contains your subversion working copy.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../../Images/LocCounterSvn.png"></p>

<p>Then, several counting options are provided:</p>

<ul>

<li>You can count the changes that have been made in the local working copy,
that have not yet been committed to SVN.</li>

<li>You can enter one or more revisions to count.  For example, imagine that
you have been working on a particular software change for a period of time.
Following an iterative development approach, you have completed portions of
the work and committed them at different times as revisions 5, 7, 10, 11, and
12. (Presumably someone else on your team committed unrelated changes as
revisions 6, 8, and 9.) You could enter "5, 7, 10-12" in this box, and the
LOC counter would show you the changes and LOC counts that were associated
with your work.</li>

<li>Some teams follow a convention where they include a special token in
their commit message.  For example, while working on Software Change Request
#42, you might include the token "SCR42" in the log message each time you
commit changes.  Once you have finished work on the Software Change Request,
you could enter "SCR42" in the third field on this form.  (Perl-style regular
expressions are also supported if you check the appropriate box.)  The
dashboard would find all of the revisions whose log message contained that
string, and would perform a count just as if those revision numbers had been
typed into the previous field.</li>

</ul>

<p>The options above can be used together: for example, to count the changes
in several committed revisions as well as local modifications.  After you
have selected the desired options, press the Count button.</p>

<h2>The Quick LOC Counter</h2>

<p>The LOC Counter Tool described above provides powerful options for LOC
counting.  For quick/simple counting needs, a web-based interface is also
provided.  You can open this web-based interface by pointing your web browser
to <u>http://localhost:2468/dash/pspdiff.htm</u>.</p>

<p class="ifpsp">In addition, a link to this LOC counter is included in the
Postmortem scripts for PSP0.1 and up.</P>

<p class="ifpsp" align="center"><img src="../../Images/PspDiffLink.png"></p>

<p>The web interface allows you to count a single file or compare two files
to each other.  For more sophisticated needs, a hyperlink at the bottom of
the page is provided to open the full-featured LOC Counter Tool.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../../Images/LocCounterWeb.png"></p>

<p>The web interface will alternatively allow you to copy and paste code
snippets that should be counted or compared.  When you do this, keep in mind
that the counter can no longer examine your filenames (e.g.
"<tt>foo.java</tt>" or "<tt>foo.cpp</tt>"), so it may have a difficult time
determining which programming language syntax to use for the count.  In that
case, you may need to enter explicit LOC Counting Options in the field at the
top of the form.</p>

<h2>The LOC Counter Report</h2>

<p>After using any of the tools above, the dashboard will generate a report
showing the number of physical LOC that you have added, deleted, and
modified. It also displays a "redlined" version of the modified files, which
can be very useful for peer reviews.</p>

<p>When you use the full-featured LOC Counter Tool, the top of the report
will also show summary tables listing the files that were added, modified, or
deleted, with individual LOC counts for each file.</p>

<p class="ifpsp">If you are using the PSP
<a href="../Planning/UsingSizeEstimatingTemplate.html">Size Estimating
Template</a>, you can drag items from these summary tables and drop them onto
rows of the Size Estimating Template.  The actual LOC for the file in
question will be applied to the target row in the Size Estimating Template.
(That this feature is most useful if your conceptual design lists items at a
file-level granularity or above.  If you prefer to create separate rows in
the Size Estimating Template for each added or modified method, you will need
to perform your own manual accounting of the LOC for each Size Estimating
row.)  You can drag several items from the LOC report onto the same row of
the Size Estimating Template, and the actual LOC contributions from each file
will be summed.  If you drop a file onto the wrong row, you can drag it to a
different row or delete it entirely.</p>


<h2>Advanced Usage</h2>

<p>Several configuration settings are provided to control the behavior of the
LOC counter.  For more information, see the 
<a href="../AdvancedTopics/ConfigurationFile.html">Advanced Configuration
Settings</a> help topic.</p>

<P>The LOC counter that is built into the Process Dashboard is extendable to 
allow user defined LOC counting rules.  For more information, see the
<a href="../AdvancedTopics/CustomLOCCounter.html">custom LOC counter</a>
help topic.</P>
