<p>As you work, the dashboard maintains a concept of the &quot;currently
active task.&quot; Items such as the play/pause button, the defect button, the
script button and the completion checkbox operate against the active task.  In
turn, the hierarchy menus allow you to see at a glance what task is currently
active, and select a different active task from within your dashboard
hierarchy.  The image below shows the dashboard ready to work on the Code
phase of "Component A," which is part of "Release 1" in "My Project".</p>

<p><center><img src="../../Images/ShowHierarchyMenus.png"></center></p>

<p>For convenience, there are two different navigation styles you can use to
select the currently active task.  The navigation style selector allows you
to choose between these two styles.</p>

<p><center><img src="../../Images/TaskNavigationStyleSelector.png"></center></p>

<h2>Navigating Tasks Hierarchically</h2>

<p>By default, the dashboard uses the hierarchical navigation style.  To
better illustrate how this hierarchical navigation style works, the following
example set of projects will be used.  (The project tree is shown in a
screenshot from the hierarchy editor.  For more information on putting
together a project hierarchy and the use of the hierarchy editor see the <a
href="../Planning/UsingHierarchyEditor.html">Using the hierarchy editor</a>
help topic.)</P>

<p><center><img src="../../Images/TaskNavigationHierarchyEditor.png"></center></p>


<P>This project hierarchy shows two top level project categories: "Project"
and "Non Project".  These are the two categories given as default when the
dashboard is first run.  Under "Project" there are four items defined: "My
Project", "Web Project", "SOA Project", and "Legacy".  Under "My Project",
several items are defined, including "Release 1".  "Release 1" has four
subtasks, called "Component A" through "Component D".  In this screenshot,
only "Component A" has been expanded to show its phases.  Phases are added
into the project hierarchy as children of a project.  "Component A" was
created from a PSP2.1 template, and so it has all the development phases of a
PSP2.1 project.</P>

<P>Back on the dashboard itself, when the first hierarchy menu is selected, 
it will show all the entries in the project hierarchy that are defined at 
that level.  In this case it shows the two default nodes "Project" and "Non 
Project".</P> 

<p><center><img src="../../Images/HierarchyMenus1.png"></center></p>

<P>Selecting the second hierarchy menu shows the entries defined at that 
level under the selection from the first menu.  In this case, the user has 
selected "Project" on the first menu, so the second menu shows the children 
of "Project" in the project hierarchy.</p>

<p><center><img src="../../Images/HierarchyMenus2.png"></center></p>

<P>Selecting any menu in the set of hierarchy menus will show the entries
defined as children under the selection on the menu to its left.  This final
example shows the PSP 2.1 process phases that are defined for "Component
A".</p>

<p><center><img src="../../Images/HierarchyMenus3.png"></center></p>

<P>To help you keep track which tasks have marked complete, the hierarchy
menus display small checkmarks next to completed items. (You can mark an
item complete with the <A HREF="CompletionButton.html">completion checkbox</A>.)</P>

<p>The dashboard window will resize itself as you navigate from task to task,
keeping itself as small as possible while still displaying the names of all
the nodes for the current task.  If you find that the dashboard is still
taking up too much horizontal space, you can resize the window to be smaller.
The hierarchy menus will display as much of the names as possible. (If you
hover over a truncated name, a tool tip will tell you the full name.)</p>

<p><center><img src="../../Images/ShowHierarchyMenusTruncated.png"></center></p>

<p>If you've done this by accident, and you want to see the full names again,
just resize the dashboard window to be bigger.</p>

<p>Another way to let the dashboard use less space is to navigate within a
subset of your project hierarchy.  If you click on the task navigation style
selector and choose "Navigate the Hierarchy...", the following window will
be displayed:</p>

<p><center><img src="../../Images/ChooseTaskNavigationRoot.png"></center></p>

<p>By default, the dashboard will be navigating within your entire project
task hierarchy.  Choosing "Top of Hierarchy" and clicking OK will request that
default behavior.  On the other hand, if you know that you will be working
within "My Project" for an extended period of time, you could select that
hierarchy node and click OK.  Then, the dashboard would hide the first two
hierarchy menus, displaying only the tasks that fall underneath "My
Project":</p>

<p><center><img src="../../Images/HierarchyMenus4.png"></center></p>

<p>When you have narrowed your view of the hierarchy this way, you can hold
your mouse over the task navigation style selector, and it will tell you
the name of the hierarchy node you are navigating within.</p>


<h2>Navigating Within a Task List</h2>

<p>If you are actively working on a project, you may find that you spend most
of your time working on tasks that are in a particular earned value task list.
A second task navigation style makes this easy.  Just click on the task
navigation style selector and choose "Navigate a Task List...".  A window
will ask you for the name of the task list that you are working on.</p>

<p><center><img src="../../Images/ChooseTaskNavigationList.png"></center></p>

<p>Select the task list that you are working on, and click OK.  The dashboard
will replace the multiple hierarchy menus with a single menu, which lists
the tasks in your task list in chronological order (as defined in the
<a href="../Planning/TaskScheduleSteps.html#flatView">flat view</a> of the
earned value schedule).

<p><center><img src="../../Images/TaskListNavigationMenu.png"></center></p>

<p>For more information on creating earned value schedules, and using the
flat view of their task lists, see the
<a href="../Planning/TaskScheduleSteps.html">Creating a schedule step by
step</a> help topic.</p>
